Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I've got to be honest, I'm blown away by the sound quality of these cheap earbuds. I downloaded the Baseus app and fooled around with the different sound settings, settling on creating a custom EQ. I admit I'm not a big bass guy but the app also has a ""mega bass"" setting which I activated and it added volume and a little thump that passed my limited bass comfort. The EQ (and bass) also added volume which is important since these clips rest close to your ear but not in the ear. I use the Shanling M0 Pro (2nd gen) which I've been using with wired Grado headphones in the gym. I didn't feel stupid with the big phones on my head since, afterall, the tennis pros and Lebron James come out wearing big phones. With several earlier buds the bluetooth connection on the Shanling did stumble and stutter a bit which I realized was not the buds but the player. The Baseus buds struggled the least, which leads me to conclude the bluetooth connection is probably stronger. As far as comfort, the 1st ime I tried them, 2 hours later I was in the shower sudsing up my head when you guessed it, I still had them on. I highly recommend these buds.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,I'm a big fan of Baseus earbuds. These things are amazing. I gave my last one to my elderly uncle who refuses to get a hearing aid... These are pretty loud and don't crack on high volume. The bass is pretty good given they're open ear.. they're extremely comfortable and very light weight. Battery life is long enough to last all night.. I sleep with them on.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,Product had great sound and comfort but did not fit my ears well. I love how you can use the app to tune them as you'd like but due to the fit I will unfortunately send them back.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"This review is for Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-ear Headphones. (in case this review is lumped together with other models they sell)They sound great in quiet environments because the overall output levels can't get very loud, made worse by lower bass response than many other open ear designs.In a quiet environment they have a very clean output that sounds pretty good if you aren't playing anything with much low frequency content.  I don't mean it doesn't match basshead expectations, I mean there's country music that you will be disappointed with the lack of strong bass.  It gets more disappointing if you specifically listen to decaf/rebassed tracks or anything that plays below about 32Hz... levels roll off pretty quickly below that, being absent below 22 or 23Hz.Pressing the open ear transducers to close off the open ear gap doesn't help much.  They are about as good as they are gonna get in their natural positions.They are good for most music.Their bluetooth range is pretty impressive.Battery endurance is super good due to truncated bass response below about 30Hz.  Usually I am seeing 12-14 hours on a single full charge, running down to 15-20% remaining.  This is a mix of music, YouTube, calls, and idle time in my work day.Comfort is really good: I can put them over my ears at 7AM and take them off at 9PM without ear fatigue or discomfort.  That beats my AfterShokz models which are bone conduction for comfort, though sound clarity is superior with these Baseus headphones.A breeze above 15mph makes phone calls disappointing, but below that or indoors they are actually great for calls.I will be buying a different set in the near future and giving these to a friend that mostly stays indoors.  Not for me, as I spend a lot of time outside in a windy state.I tried all supported Codecs, and leave them connected by LDAC or AptX HD.  These are good enough to tell the difference between higher bit rate codecs and SBC easily.My biggest issue is that they don't get loud enough for use in a noisy city street, and secondary they roll off the bass output above the bottom end of typical modern country, R&B, or Hip Hop music tracks.I am not looking for extra bass, only balanced bass that accurately plays evenly down to what an organ or bass drum should sound like.So, tldr: good soundfield recreation if you are okay with truncated bass spectrum and lower total output in trade for excellent battery endurance.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"Very reasonable. Loud and clear! I mostly wear one at a time at work and one is good enough to hear music clearly and the outside noise. When both are in, I cant hear anything outside unless the volume is very low. Great earphones for the price. I would definitely purchase these again. As a matter of fact, I tried ordering 3 more pairs for Christmas gifts but the order was delayed and wouldn't arrive on time. I was unfortunately, forced to cancel. I'll try again after the New Year of 2026!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-Ear Headphones Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I purchased these based on a New York Times Wirecutter recommendation. I'm used to bone conducting headsets, so this form factor was different. They were a little awkward to put on, but only slightly - I likely would have gotten used to it in time. I appreciated that they had physical buttons, making it easy to play/pause, fast-forward and so on (although the buttons could be a little larger). It's not clear if there's a way to turn them off without putting them in the case. The intention is clearly to carry the case around with you at all times - a little awkward, as the case isn't tiny.These didn't interfere with my glasses and I had no significant issues with comfort for long-term wear, at least not from a couple days of use. (I'm practically always listening to podcasts and audiobooks, so I wear a Bluetooth headset all day long). Wearing them around other people may be off-putting: although these are open-ear headsets, so you can still hear normally, it LOOKS like you have headphones in your ears, so people may assume you aren't listening.My only major issue is battery life. The listing is proud to claim 45 hours of battery life... but that's talking about the charge in the case, not in the earpieces. Supposedly the earpieces should last 8 hours. I didn't measure it very scientifically, but my impression was that they lasted about 2-3 hours. Even if I'm wildly mistaken, they definitely wouldn't last more than 5 hours. So these are only useful if you're putting them in the case and letting them recharge multiple times a day. That's not how I use Bluetooth headsets: I leave them on all day so I can play audio anytime, and often for long periods of time. These are fine for a workout, but not for all-day use.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"Pretty good for the price. They stay in when working in the yard, and mute the chainsaw noise quite well. Base is good but with a name like Baseus, I kinda expected a bit more low end. Comfortable and a nice, long battery life have been my experience. Overall excellent built quality and the app is useful and intuitive. If the Soundcore Liberty 5 Pros were out, I'd have went that way, but I'm not disappointed with these earbuds.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"The Inspire XP1 earbuds deliver excellent sound with Bose tuning and Dolby Spatial Audio.

Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"The Baseus Inspire XP1 earbuds are amazing!

Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"I’ve been using these earbuds for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed. The sound quality is clear with solid bass, and they connect instantly to my phone every time. The charging case feels sturdy and compact, easy to carry in my pocket.The battery life is excellentI can use them for hours without worrying about recharging. The green indicator light is helpful, and the case charges quickly through USB-C.They fit comfortably in my ears and don’t fall out even when I’m walking or working out.

Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"I’ve been using the Baseus Inspire XP1 for a while now, and I’m really impressed! The sound quality is excellent — deep bass, clear vocals, and crisp highs. The noise cancelling works surprisingly well, blocking out most background noise even in busy places.They’re super comfortable to wear for long periods, and the fit feels natural and secure. I also love how clear the call quality is — the 6-mic system really makes a difference. Battery life is fantastic too; I can go days without recharging.Overall, these earbuds easily compete with much more expensive brands. Highly recommended for anyone looking for great sound, comfort, and long battery life!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"Overall, very solid buds. Their sound, battery, controls, feel, fit, and in app support is all very solid.Let’s start with the pros.Sound quality is clean with an emphasis on the low and on highs, so a bit of a V Shape tuning. The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn’t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2’s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It’s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price. I love the magnet on them since Baseus products usually have a strong magnet to them.Now for the cons.Sound quality is great, superb even, but the classics bass thump is lacking a bit. I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn’t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have. The XH1’s have it, and so it was mildly surprising to see these didn’t have it.Fit is good, but it could definitely be better. With light use and not as heavy a move, they wouldn’t fall out, but if I were to exercise, these would most likely slip. The limited use of 3 eartips definitely does not help.App Support could also be better. The Dolby Audio isn’t the best and custom EQ doesn’t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from. They sound quieter and a bit more flat. Also, as mentioned the above, the lack of bass boost button is upsetting.Overall, my experience with these have been positive so far and will keep testing them out.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"To prefice, for 100$ these are great. Definitely worth the price. They sound really good overall, nothing is emphasised throughout the frequency raise. If anything, it has a little too much treble but not enough to cause listening fatigue. Because of this as well as the punchy, smooth bass and relaxed midrange everything sounds very nice and clear. Zero complaints really. The earbuts themselves are nice and compact, they feel premium, and connectivity is easy and quick. Definitely feels like they'll last for years to come.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XP1 Adaptive Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Baseus,"I didn't expect much when I first ordered.But now I'm using it for a month, it actually has a really good quality!

Baseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"Have you ever felt the gut rumbling (sub) bass?  As in with a few 18"" subwoofers going low and everything just rumble?  Now imagine hearing the same bass but without feeling it.  It's quite surreal and surreal is the best way to describe it when you are wearing this item and it hits the low bass.  You just don't feel it in your gut.  So revelation no. 1, yes, you can hear low bass, and no. 2, the BP1 Pro is pretty good.The item came nicely packaged, unlike the many cheap imports in plain plastic bags or cardboard boxes, it has a properly printed box with Hi-Res Audio (Wireless) label displayed prominently.  In addition, there is a bass label, too.  Never seen that before.  It also displays 55-hours battery life, -50dB adaptive hybrid ANC (active noise cancellation), IP55 splash resistant.  All very good characteristics for a set of true wireless in-ear earbuds.  And let's not forget the obligatory AI product association with 6-mic AI clear calls.  This item simply check all the boxes.  And that's just what's printed on the box!  The many functions aside, it also meets all the certifications as well, according to all the certification labels on the box, not to mention recycling directions.  All in multiple languages.  In fine print, it also boasts 58ms dual channel ultra low latency,  Something about bass boost and treble balance ""tuned by Baseus App"".  I might have to look into that but, spoiler alert, it already sounds very good.  It shows 10 minutes rapid recharge for 2-5 hours of play time and can seamlessly connect to two different devices.  Then there's a symbol for not including an AC adapter, and another that indicates it will support 2-5W chargers.  Inside the box, you will find the charging case with the ear buds in them, extra sets of ear tips for different ear cannel sizing, and an USB-A to USB-C charge cord.  True to advertisement, charging was indeed fast using a higher powered USB-C charger.  It went from pulsating green to solid green in no time to which I interpret as being fully charged.  Opening the lid starts the pairing process and putting them in your ear you can hear your paired device audio output.  They fit perfectly in my ears out of the box and are quite comfortable with the included tips.  Don't even have to swap tips, bonus!  And I already raved about the bass that it can hit low.  The treble is good, too, not shrilly, but very pleasant.  The mids aren't forward but not too laid back either.  So far with the music I've tried, it's at least a b+ tier sound to my ears, easily beat the Air Pod Pro and even possibly be on par with the Moon Drop Space Travel.  More comparisons will be necessary and I'll update with any further discoveries.  The build quality and material used also means it will be quite durable.I chose to pair it with my Android phone running current up to date version with Developer Mode enabled.  It even displays its name properly (unlike many cheap devices that use weird names).  Even with Developer mode enabled, however, LDAC CODEC option is still grayed out.  Sad face.  I thought I saw somewhere in the description that it had LDAC support.  I'll have to check with one of the AI models and see if it can be un-grayed out.  Maybe download the app will help.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I seldom write reviews, but I can't pass up this one . I was pleasantly surprised by these earbuds. The sound quality is on par with much higher-priced brands, delivering clear highs, solid bass, and an overall balanced profile that makes music and calls sound great. The companion app is refreshingly straightforward—the controls are simple and intuitive, without the clutter you find in some other brands. On top of that, the earbuds fit my ears perfectly, staying comfortable even during long use.Overall, an excellent value that easily exceeds expectations.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"First ImpressionsThis initial review is mostly for sound only. I am referencing these to my Technics AZ Series, which to this day, by far, the best sounding, clearest, most enjoyable tws earbuds I have come across. This goes for soundstage, depth, clarity across ranges, and what I consider faithfulness in sound reproduction, what Dre refers to as how the music is meant to be heard. Only the Technics has been able to shine across all these dimensions, coming from a horn, drums, percussion, and guitar player.That said, against this reference the BP1s in Noise Cancelling mode holds its own against my Technics in sound clarity, particularly with the bass as oft mentioned, and the highs which are close, but noticeably not par. Fades, sizzles, done right. This is impressive for the price, a mere fraction of what the Technics is at. Also the battery life is much, much better. Much less range anxiety.LDAC needs to be vetted more, particularly with an LDAC supported source, one of my fav being the Quad DAC LG G series, if you can find one that works. The music on those devices are legendary, on par with Technics, but LG never has been recognized for it. I anticipate the LDAC being impressive also, but once again not on par with something like a reference bud, although with the right app and settings I'm absolutely certain it can match it. Based on what I'm hearing as I'm typing, the Baseus BP1 has what it takes to reach that level, it just needs the right help.I'll add to this once I get to play with the settings more, as I'm not a fan of downloading apps just to control the sound or use. Hasn't been used on calls, not sure I want to. There's dedicated buds for that. I haven't submerged these in water yet either. And the tips haven't been fully optimized. I'm trying not to use the Spinfits I have even though they have solid collars. They cause itchiness and discomfort, unlike their mainland counterparts. That said, word to Floss, the BP1s are a ""major, major, major GO.""",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I was really excited to try these out and man was I surprised with how great they sound especially for the price. They connected right away and the app makes the biggest difference with pretty much any earbuds these days and this one's no different. You can adjust anything and everything from the app making these sound absolutely incredible for the price. I would have thought these were $50+ just listening to them then seeing all the adjustments as well makes these a steal. They fit great, sound great, and the battery lasts forever as well.If you're on the fence, jump down and buy these now!Also, I want to give a shout out to their customer service for being absolutely top notch. I had an issue with something and they more than fixed it. Will definitely be buying from Baseus again and again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I’ve been getting close to what the product claims, and the charging case feels sturdy.

Baseus E20 True Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I've been using the E20 True Wireless Earbuds for a few weeks now, so I feel comfortable sharing my thoughts on them. I've used them while commuting, working out, relaxing at home, and even taking calls while doing other things. The earbuds connected to my phone in a matter of seconds and were ready to use. I didn't have to set them up again after that. Now, every time I take them out of the case, they connect right away. I thought they were comfortable in my ears when I put them on. They stayed in place for hours without causing any pain or pressure. The sound was rich and balanced, and the bass added depth without drowning out the rest of the track. I also use them a lot to watch videos, and the clarity makes it easy to understand what people are saying. I got many calls while I was cooking or walking the dog, and the person on the other end could hear me without me having to repeat myself. The battery life surprised me as well; I only had to charge the case every now and then because each listening session was so long. The fact that they are water-resistant makes me feel better about using them in more active situations. Despite frequent use in pockets, bags, and the charging case, they maintained their original appearance and functionality. The E20 earbuds have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, sound quality, and battery life after using them every day for the past few weeks. Whether I'm at home, at the gym, or out running errands, they are now a simple and dependable part of my daily routine. They can be used for almost any activity because they have a long battery life, a stable connection, and clear sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus E20 True Wireless Earbuds,Baseus,"I have long been a fan of the quality delivered by this manufacturer at an affordable price. When given the opportunity to take the E20 for a spin, I jumped at it!  No surprise, these are AMAZING for their price point of $19.99 (at time of review). As advertised, the bass is deep and vibrant. The mid-tones are good and the high-notes are not at all ""tinny"".  I find the stereo to be well balanced though the ""sound stage"" is definitely on the flat side - but, for $20, one cannot expect 7.1 surround sound. The fit is great out of the box and pairing to my phone was a breeze. With a full charge and some pep in my step I set out the door for a quick run and found that the volume levels are acceptable for exercise and that I could safely hear approaching traffic WITH noise canceling turned on or off. Voices on audiobooks/podcasts were clear and distinguishable while my '80s playlist rocked right around the block.  For $20, the fact it includes ANY level of noise cancellation is shocking so, being that its effect is a bit weak isn't a huge surprise or disappointment.  Operation is simple, with single, double and triple taps on either ear doing the job of answering calls or controlling music/chapters.  The charging case, as always, handles like a wet bar of soap but the buds pop right in and return to a full charge FAST.  Due to their solid sound, easy pairing and operation and PHENOMENAL price point, I give these a FULL recommendation and highly suggest these as gifts for ANY gift exchange with a price limit of $20!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus BS1 NC Semi-in-Ear Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Baseus,"The Noise Reduction actually works surprisingly well for earbuds that are not the in-ear type. This mode is a bit more ""hissy"" than what you would hear with in-ear buds. Fortunately the hiss does not increase with volume level, so if you listen at ""normal"" volume and the music doesn't have a very quiet passage, you probably won't notice it.The Gesture Settings controls offer very good customization options. Lots of flexibility for the tap commands. However, although you can adjust volume level, there is no aural feedback to let you know you've reached the maximum setting. Other earbuds I've tried do have this feature.If you are sitting still or walking, they stay in the ear pretty well. My left ear must have a bit of an odd shape because that one loosens up and doesn't sound as good when it does. The right one is fine though.EQ mode - If you are using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings, the only EQ mode you can use is ""Baseus Classic"" . If you attempt to switch to another EQ setting, it turns off Spatial Acoustics, which degrades both the volume level and sound quality.The Spatial Acoustics settings actually sound pretty good, but no EQ customization is possible. Personally I prefer the Cinema setting as it is a little less harsh in the high end.Bass Boost - there are five levels to choose from, but none of them have any noticeable effect on the sound.The stock EQ mode settings are OK, but there isn't much difference between them, and you cannot actually see a graph of which frequencies are boost/cut for each.The customizable EQ is shockingly bad. No matter what you do, I will bet money that you cannot make it sound even halfway decent.  Sounds like AM radio to me. Completely worthless to the user.The charge indicator light on the case is pretty useless. There is no readout of battery level, just a single LED indicator that changes color depending on charge level. The highest level indicator - green - means the battery level is between 40% and 100%. That's quite a range! There isn't even a case battery level readout in the phone app.The case does not accommodate wireless charging.Bottom line: these earbuds are pretty comfortable, and sound pretty decent when using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings. If you like to customize your sound with EQ, you will likely be as disappointed with these buds as I am.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus BS1 NC Semi-in-Ear Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Baseus,"I've been looking for a pair of budget earbuds with good sound quality and decent ANC and have been disappointed with almost everything I've tried. So many make claims that are a real stretch, if not totally false. At full price, these are a solid contender, and on sale are an amazing value. They have great sound quality, especially when utilizing the customizations in the app. The sound is full and natural. The ANC is actually effective. I haven't compared them to higher dollar products, but within this price range I'm really impressed.Unfortunately, I'm still trying to decide if I can keep them or not. I wasn't paying attention and didn't notice that these don't have the rubber ear inserts so they don't stay in my ears very well when I'm moving around a lot.

Baseus Bass BS1 NC Semi-in-Ear True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Baseus,Baseus has been my go to brand for charging blocks and cables for a couple of years now.

Baseus Bass BS1 NC Semi-in-Ear True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Baseus,"The Noise Reduction actually works surprisingly well for earbuds that are not the in-ear type. This mode is a bit more ""hissy"" than what you would hear with in-ear buds. Fortunately the hiss does not increase with volume level, so if you listen at ""normal"" volume and the music doesn't have a very quiet passage, you probably won't notice it.The Gesture Settings controls offer very good customization options. Lots of flexibility for the tap commands. However, although you can adjust volume level, there is no aural feedback to let you know you've reached the maximum setting. Other earbuds I've tried do have this feature.If you are sitting still or walking, they stay in the ear pretty well. My left ear must have a bit of an odd shape because that one loosens up and doesn't sound as good when it does. The right one is fine though.EQ mode - If you are using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings, the only EQ mode you can use is ""Baseus Classic"" . If you attempt to switch to another EQ setting, it turns off Spatial Acoustics, which degrades both the volume level and sound quality.The Spatial Acoustics settings actually sound pretty good, but no EQ customization is possible. Personally I prefer the Cinema setting as it is a little less harsh in the high end.Bass Boost - there are five levels to choose from, but none of them have any noticeable effect on the sound.The stock EQ mode settings are OK, but there isn't much difference between them, and you cannot actually see a graph of which frequencies are boost/cut for each.The customizable EQ is shockingly bad. No matter what you do, I will bet money that you cannot make it sound even halfway decent.  Sounds like AM radio to me. Completely worthless to the user.The charge indicator light on the case is pretty useless. There is no readout of battery level, just a single LED indicator that changes color depending on charge level. The highest level indicator - green - means the battery level is between 40% and 100%. That's quite a range!

Baseus Inspire XC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"As a previous owner the Baseus MC1 Pro, I already had high expectations for the XC1.The MC1 Pro sounded great and was very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more ""clicky"" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple ""beep"" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no ""in field"" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not ""Best in class"" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"Baseus really hit a homerun with these. I was a little skeptical at first just from the clip on design itself and the fact that most clipons ive tried have left me feeling disappointed. But these are an absolute MUST buy for anyone looking for a clip on.The sound is awesome, at low volume (30% or so) they do a great job of still being clearly audible and having a bass that is still present. Once you crank it up to 70-80 they definitely pump out some nice sound. Top that off with the nice soft rubber grips and a sturdy fit you have yourself not only a comfortable earbud but a great WORKOUT earbud.The battery life is good as well, i went a whole session with volume at about 60% and got almost 9 hours from them which is insane. The button on each earbud can be customized with many options to choose from which is nice too. I haven't necessarily used them for calls specifically but ended up using them on a discord call and got zero complaints so i assume they must be fine as well.Overall these are easy to recommend for anyone interested in clip ons and especially as a gift option.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Inspire XC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"I just purchased these Baseus open ear buds to replace my old Jlab ones. So far they are great. I primarily use them for music listening while still being able to pick up outside sounds and keep mobile. The Bose bass sounds excellent with no distortion. They are lightweight and comfortable with thoughtful little rubber nubs where they come in contact with your ears. Buttons work fine. I personally like the open ear ring type buds. They look like some kind of cyber-tribal piercing thing, which works for me. I still wish they’d invent an accessory miniature subwoofer that clips into your nostrils through.Update 12/25: After a couple of months I’m still liken’ these ear bud. My only issues are the little control buttons. The ‘feel’ of the buttons when pressed doesn’t do it for me. It’s hard to tell when you’re activating a command. I have a feeling these will not last  in prolonged use. Also the buttons would be better bigger and maybe knurled rubber caps for easier use. I should also mention that the charger case is horrible. It’s larger than the cheaper Jlab one that this replaced and very, very difficult to open. It needs a recessed finger groove or something.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie MC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,I use these all the time. The open ear design means I can hear my surroundings and the audio coming from the earbuds perfectly. I am an equestrian and use these with my coach so I can hear her better in crowded environments like at shows or windy days. They stay on great and never had them slip or move while I was riding or running. I recently lost the case at the airport and e-mailed the company to see if I could just buy the case since I still had the earbuds. They were kind enough to send me a new set! Not only are these earbuds fantastic quality and a great price but the customer service is top notch and quick to respond.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie MC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"I really prefer open-earbuds to in-earbuds, cuz after I got some foam tips for better comfort - my ears still get ""swamp ear"" and get irritated after long use. So I bought Bose Ultra open buds and Shokz open fit buds. Usually I say they are good for what it’s worth. In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it. I finally decided to see if there was a better alternative and stumbled upon these Baseus Bowie MC1 clip earbuds, which seemed like they could be the answer.❤🧡💛💚💙💜Pro’s:The fit is excellent, the sound is excellent, the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won’t fall off, comfortable. When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears. The sound was good when I was running.The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market. For me and my ears, the Baseus is an excellent buy. These are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the Baseus really improved. I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with. I still like the Baseus ear clip design vs the earhook. So which do I prefer. Running and exercising-Baseus without a doubt.Bose Ultra is too expensive, can’t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds. They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting. Should be priced around the Soundcore and Shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end. For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity. Most of all a larger and louder volume level. I’m returning them. My Baseus Bowie MC1 do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged. These are a great option for an open-ear design at this price point, the sound is very full and balanced, impressive bass and volume without becoming distorted, I rarely feel the need to turn them up too much even when in a noisy area.❤🧡💛💚💙💜What I liked:❤1) Very comfortable, light weight, you will not even know that you are wearing it🧡2) Easy to put on and remove and just one clicker on the back of the ear on each earbud to control settings like volume, play next or previous track, take a call or end it or cycle through the modes (default list of modes can be assigned to each earbud so that you can cycle through the shortcuts you use the most).💛3) Pushing it downwards inside the ear gives a higher bass and louder sound. My ears are small so this could be different for different ear sizes. The sound quality is premium and you can move it a bit to find the right spot for best sound.💚4) Call quality is good. I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside💙6) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music.💜7) Baseus app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available.❤8) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life. Up to 9-10 hours of play time and up to an extra 31 hours of battery life in the charging case.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie MC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"I bought these as a second round choice to some JBL earpods I initially purchased and ended up returning immediately.The JBL earpods would not consistently stay in my ear no matter the provided ear adapter I tried.I was originally hesitant about buying these ""clip-on"" style ones as a replacement.But after trying them out I was extremely satisfied.They are super lightweight, comfortable, and STAY in place no matter how hard I seem to move or shake my head.I have worn them doing sweaty rough yardwork with no issues at all.Sound/volume might vary a tiny bit depending where the speaker sits in your ear once clipped on.And like all earpods, you don't get the same bass as over-ear headphones...However I think these have all around good sound and listen to rock/metal, EDM, rap, podcasts, etc on them.Charging is quick and easy.Connection/pairing seems to work extremely well and is very seamless placing in/out of the case.Range seems comparable to larger headphones.I would give them 4 1/2 stars, knocking half a star off for better bass (if possible in such a compact package).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie MC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"I have tried so many earbuds, but they always fall out of my ears. I bought some other cheaper out of ear headphones, but they were garbage. These are fantastic! They stay on, I hear great through them, they hold a charge a really long time (probably about 8 hours of straight use) and the case holds a charge for about a week. They are lightweight and comfortable. A little bit of trouble with phone calls sometimes, but other times it’s fine, so it could be another issue. I love them so much!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Bowie MC1 Open Ear Clip-On Earbuds,Baseus,"First of all, I really love this open ear earbuds.  They are very comfortable, loose but still secure.  Sound is good enough, including some level of bass. Build quality is good too.  Overall I really like them and plan to keep them.HOWEVER, after a week of use, I realize the ear buds mic will stop working either when I walk away from my laptop like going to bathroom or kitchen.  It seems the disconnection is random to me.  I am not sure it's because of distance or period of not streaming.  But the worst is the mic will not work properly even the earbuds reconnect with my laptop.  I HAVE to unpair and repair the earbuds with my laptop.  As I use this earbuds for work from home meetings, this random disconnection / malfunction of mic is such a pain that finally I decided to return the earbuds.  It is such a shame.  I did see one another user commented the same issue but I thought that was random.  But in my case, it happens pretty much everyday.... so if you want to use this earbuds for meetings, be careful.  Otherwise this earbuds is almost perfect for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Bowie MC1 Pro Open Ear Earbuds,Baseus,"Really comfy! With the clip-on design and soft silicone padding, I hardly notice I’m wearing them, even on long runs. The sound is solid for open-ear earbuds: midrange and vocals feel clear, though there’s no earth-shattering bass. For running, they’re actually great, super lightweight, stay in place, and let you hear your surroundings, which is perfect for safety.The IP67 rating also gives me confidence when I sweat or run in light rain.Bottom line: Highly recommended if comfort and awareness are your priorities.

Baseus Bowie MC1 Pro Open Ear Earbuds,Baseus,"I really like these earbuds. I tried other earbuds in bestbuy, and decided I'd rather not waste hundreds of dollars on a wireless earbud set. I am a huge fan of brands that offer their customers high quality items without having a huge price tag, and I respect these brands as long as they keep pumping out high quality items.These earbuds are extremely loud, the sound is 10/10, it feels like I'm listening out of a high quality stereo speaker phone that is in my ear. I love that these DO NOT have touch control, because it makes it easier to use during rain or shower, which I did do today. I wore these in the shower and the sound remained 10/10, something that no other earbud I ever owned was able to achieve. No muffled sound, no loss in quality, absolutely amazing in water.Also, the bass is pretty useless in this, but it doesnt matter too much because the sound quality makes up for it 100 percent.The battery life is good, I've been wearing them all day and they have a very premium build quality.The only thing I prefer, is more tighter or smaller rings, also I am unsure on how long the rubber parts will last. Other than these two worries, this is a 10/10 device and I am recommending them to everyone, and the app is so intuitive.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Bowie MC1 Pro Open Ear Earbuds,Baseus,"Disappointed. The sound quality is nominal--nothing spectacular--particularly the bass. Enhanced or not the bass is barely noticeable. The app gave it a little boost but if you are an audiophile and you want them for music, don't bother. The  FF/Next feature and the Previous feature do not work as tapping only results in Volume Control and Pause and Play regardless to the number of taps/beeps. I would surmise that although it is comfortable, it is not suited to all ear sizes because the ""speaker"" does not position itself in the same spot on every ear. For the price, I will be returning these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie 30 Max Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"Looking for the ultimate escape into your own world of sound? Look no further than the Baseus Bowie 30 Max Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. These sleek, over-the-ear headphones deliver unparalleled audio quality and immersive experiences, especially with the addition of Spatial Audio.🟥🟧🟨🟩🎧Sound🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5’s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced. The Bowie 30 Max are quickly becoming my favorite. They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max. They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp. The 45’s require a lot of equalizer use, while the Bowie 30 Max still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🎧Spatial Audio with Head Tracking🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪What sets these headphones apart is their Spatial Audio feature, which takes your listening experience to the next level. Feel like you're right in the middle of the action, with sound that surrounds you in all directions, adding depth and dimension to your favorite content. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment. (Same as Bose QC Ultra, Airpods Max)🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥🎧Noise Cancelling🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥I would say, at $99 ANC definetly worth the price. For the low-frequency noises, you know the annoying engine sound, it does the job same as Bose on airplanes! But for the higher frequency noises like people talking, I think it is above average, better than good but not Sony/Bose level. The one thing about the Bose/Sony is their ability to block ambient noise adaptively, but Bowie 30 Max only takes a 1/4 price of them, probably 1/5 with a coupon or a deal.🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🎧Comfort🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight. I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they’re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time. I don’t work out, but I would imagine they’d maintain their fit during exercise.🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🎧Battery Life🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪The battery life is super incredible and lasts like a full week if you were to use these all day everyday. I’ve had these only like two weeks and I’ve only charged it twice but I use these alot. I think I average about 3-4 hours a day wearing these during the week, and usually charge them once a week, but I don't let them get super low either. Charge super fast, 10 mins for 14 hours of use is just ridiculous.🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥🟧🟨🎧Multi-point Connectivity🎧🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫🟥🟧🟨They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45’s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.

Baseus Bowie 30 Max Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"The sound quality is truly remarkable for the price range. The noise cancelling and bluetooth are also impressive. You do have to set up the different profiles once in the app but from there it's fairly easy to use and quickly became my default headphone due to the comfortable fit and sound quality. This was remarkable to because I also have headsets which at 10-15x the price, so to say this is great value for money would be an understatement.The caveat - They've tried to give it a more high end aesthetic BUT the plastic used is still relatively brittle and did start to crack within 2 months. The earcups also started loosening. I've some experience fixing things so it's fine as a daily driver but I wouldn't wear these to the gym or on a flight in their current condition.Overall, great sound but it's got a life of ~6 months while I've headsets from Bose or Sennheiser that I've had for 3-5 years so you do get a much shorter life",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bowie 30 Max Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"I have listened to every kind of music genre with these, and I'm never fail to be blown away. The crispness of the instruments. The clarity of the voices. The thundering of the bass. The hair on my arms stands up. I have this test song that I use to grade clarity (don't laugh), Imperial March, Darth Vader's Theme. You can hear each instrument so clearly. You can pick each one out. On another song I listened to, I could even hear the pages being turned by the members of the orchestra, and you could hear the hair of the bow as it went across the bridge of the violin. Insane. Then I use Madman Across the Water by Elton John. You can hear each pick of the string on his guitar in the beginning. Go back and listen to You're So Vain by Carly Simon. I had NO IDEA that Mick Jagger sung the backup vocals. I could hear him belting out the words. I had to look it up to be sure because he's uncredited on the album. He was friends with her and he was just there the day she was recording and jumped in. Lastly, Head Like a Hole by Nine Inch Nails...it sounds like you're in the middle of a concert hall. You dont even have to have the spatial audio turned on for any of these songs, as the headphones are so good right out of the box, in Hi Fi live EQ mode. The ONLY thing I would change about them, is to make a fabric cushion on the headband, I stead of the pleather, because these suckers slide around if you move your head around too much. I tried laying down from a sitting down position, and the headphones made it to the pillow before I did. I'd still recommend them to anyone!!! The sound will blow your mind. Keep in mind, your sound experience is only as good as the quality of the music. The better it was mixed, the better it will sound. 70's music seems to have been more creatively, artistically and carefully mixed for some reason, and there are so many ""easter eggs"". The coolest feature about these is the on/off switch. You definitely know you've turned them off! The battery lasts forever! The light indicators on the outside of each cup are so helpful to let you know they're charging (blue) and when they're done (red). No guessing! Don't hesitate to buy these! Not at this price!Btw, they DO fold up, I just have a hard case.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"Took some time to get used to the feel of these as I've been using inner ear earbuds for years.  It was very easy to connect through bluetooth, the sound clarity on various tyes of music and podcasts are top notch.  I like that there are also specific buttons on the ear pieces so I can raise or lower volume, skip ahead, or take a call.  They're very comfortable and I don't get the constant usage itchiness from having something in my ear canal.  it clips onto my ear very easily with little broadcast ""speakers"" sitting outside my ear, they fit nicely and haven't moved to matter how much I may sweat.  i couldn't tell you the battery life yet but I've used them now for 3 days and as I take them out of the charging case they're still full of power.  The box says they're good for a totalk of 38 hours, if that isn't the case I'll edit my post, but it seems realisting.  At the sale price I got these for here on Amazon,. I'd say theis was an excellent value and the best purchase I've made this year so far. n",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"These open-ear earbuds have been a great upgrade from traditional in-ear styles. They sit comfortably without pressing into the ear canal, so I can wear them for long periods without any pain or irritation. The open-ear design also makes it easy to stay aware of what’s going on around me while still getting clear, balanced sound.They’re lightweight, secure, and perfect for everyday use—whether I’m walking, working, or listening to something at home. If regular earbuds tend to hurt your ears, these are a wonderful alternative that still deliver really good audio quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"These are currently my favorite headphones.  I'll highlight the pro's and few con's (because they are perfect) below...Pros:--Price.  I got these super cheap on sale (~$20).  From a quality and features standpoint, these headphones punch way above their class.--Super comfortable.  They are light but, more importantly, don't feel intrusive.  I love the open ear design.  Nothing is jammed in my ear resulting in zero fatigue, hot spots or swamp ear.  I have taken naps with them on (love being able to listen to music while napping).  Also, as someone who wears glasses, I love that there's no contact of any point between the headphones and glasses.  There's no feeling of pressure or the glasses sitting funny.--Physical buttons (especially at this price point).  I appreciate physical buttons over touch sensitivity.  It allows for precise execution of functions.-The accompanying app.  I think this feature separates these headphones from other low cost headphones.  I love that I'm able to select from different EQ setting to find one that best fits my tastes.  It can also be customized but my ears aren't that particular.  The ability to customize the button functions is also appreciated.--Sound.  To me, the sound quality is excellent overall.  The volume is loud enough against outside ambient noise while the open ear design allows me to hear my surroundings.  Couple with the EQ settings, my music sounds great.  With the volume down enough, I can also carry on conversations without having to remove them.--Fit.  They go with little fuss and stay on!  This allows me to enjoy my music while playing sports.  The only time they've moved out of place was when I accidentally hit them.Cons:--The Finding Headphone feature in the app.  It isn't completely useless as it will show the headphone's last active location but, the call L/R feature does not work unless they are out of the case and in use.  This lack of functionality caused me to think that I lost my headphones.  After replacing them with a different set of headphone that were on sale at the time (Soundcore V20i), they were found in my jacket pocket hanging in the closet at home lol.-Phone calls.  In louder settings, it was hard to hear my calls, even at maximum volume.  The mic, however, seemed fine as I have never gotten complaints.--Playtime (this is the main reason why I dropped a star).  I'm getting nowhere near the 7.5 hour playtime on a single charge.  I may be getting 5 hours at low to moderate volume.  For home use, this is totally fine as I'm constantly popping them on and off.  In the office, however, I would have them on all the time (because of the comfort).  Even though 15 minutes of charge will get me 2 more hours of play to get me through the rest of my work day, I opt to use the Soundcore V20i that I bought when I thought these were lost.  Although not as comfortable with glasses on, they last my entire work day.--Quality control.  This is more of a nit-pick, but the button on the right earpiece is more sunken in than the one on the left almost eliminating haptic feedback.  I can't tell when it's pressed.  This makes using it challenging enough to discourage me from using it.  I mainly use it to increase the volume but will use the phone instead (when it's with me).Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend them.  For the price, they are hard to beat.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"I love these! I have the BP1 Pro which are good, but they don't stay put when I'm active, so I'm constantly having to adjust them. The BC1 clip on headphones solves this problem completely. Since they're open ear, they aren't noise-cancelling, but in return you get incredible comfort (nothing sticking in your ear canal) and most importantly, they don't fall out or move around. This design is genius. The sound is different, but I actually prefer it. There's a place for noise-cancelling earbuds (mowing the lawn), but the greater comfort far outweighs the benefit of noise cancellation in most situations. The sound itself is more natural and comfortable for TV viewing and other long listening situations, no ear fatigue. I've had zero issues with them so far, they are definitely my new favorite earbuds. For noise cancellation earbuds, I do prefer my Anker Soundcore2 over my BC1 Pro, though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"Good sound, comfortable, good battery time, but the left earpiece mostly cuts out after a couple miles. Cleaned and charged, same issue on next run. I do sweat a lot, so maybe it's just me, but right now returning for a replacement.  If it would just completely cut out would actually be better, but it just starts sporadically connecting for a second and cuts out, so it's pretty annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Bass BC1 Open Ear Earbuds Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"i got this one prime day deal, which was mid $20. my airpods that i leave at work were dying and i thought why not give this a try at $25s and after using it for couple of hours and doing some tweaking, i am amazed by it.out of the box, the sound was subpar. at least what i was used to from airpods. but if you download the app and change the EQ, for me i choose Jazz, the sound is decent. again, you have to factor in the price.as far as comfort goes, it's not like you dont notice them on, but it's secure and light enough.i am giving this a 5 stars bc of price. you wont find any good looking, good build quality, decent sound headphones at this price. i think this could be at right under $50 and i would still give it a solid 4.5-5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Bowie MC1 Pro Open Ear Clip-On Headphones,Baseus,"Was looking for earbuds that felt secure on my ears while I moved around, something I found lacking in the more traditional design. These seemed like a good-quality product at a reasonable price and I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed. Setup took less than a minute, and the battery's been impressive, have only charged the case once since I got it last Friday. The buds themselves are very comfortable on the ear. I've worn them sitting at my desk, walking around, and laying on my back and side while also wearing my CPAP mask. They stayed put every time. The sound quality is really impressive, particularly the bass. One thing I did notice was that sometimes a song will start playing on one bud before being picked up by the other one. Thought that was a little weird, but that might've been caused by my phone or the app I was streaming from at the time. I haven't made many calls with the headphones yet but I did demo the mic for a friend via a Whatsapp message. Listening back, both she and I found it to be a bit lacking in clarity, but that might also have been an issue with my connection. Overall, I like these earbuds a lot and look forward to our travels together.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"I’ve been using these headphones almost every day for a week and I’m honestly really impressed.

They’re super comfortable too — the ear pads are soft and don’t get hot even after hours of use. The battery life is amazing; I only need to charge them once a week. The build feels solid and the design looks very clean and premium.

Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"I recently got the Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones in Cosmic Black, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations! The sound quality is simply phenomenal, thanks to Sound by Bose and Dolby Spatial Audio. It's like being enveloped in a 360° soundscape, making my music and podcasts come alive. The noise cancellation is impressive, blocking out almost all surrounding noise, which is perfect for my noisy office environment. What I love most is how comfortable they are; I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. The battery life is outstanding, lasting me several days without needing a charge. Also, the Bluetooth connection is quick and super stable. For the price, these headphones outperform even more expensive brands, making them a fantastic investment.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"These headphones punch above their price! Please, be advised that to get the most out of these headphones you have to do 4 things out of the box: (1) charge it full, (2) download the app, which is awesome, and connect the headphones to the bluetooth source, (3) update the headphones’ firmware, (4) go to the Soundfit feature and follow the instructions step by step. Soundfit actually adjusts the headphone sound to the sound frequencies as you hear then! Once Soundfit works its magic, test the headphones to your favorite music or movie. To my ears, they sound awesome! If you have android equipment, turn on the LDAC to get cd quality sound. The controls are physical and easy to use and can be adjusted via the app, which also allows you to equalize the sound to your liking or choose between the Sound by Bose (my favorite setting), Dolby or extra Bass, or any other of the aound presets.Wireless connectivity is great and I had no issues with calls. They are comfortable and fit alright to my head. They seem well built and are heavy compared to good headphones like the $30 Tozo HT2. As fir durability, time will tell. For the Black Friday price of $99.99 that includes a storage case (that by itself would sell for $10-$20) and a free gift, these headphones are a no brainer buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"I think it's important to mention I have an IOS phone(apple) and a windows laptop. I wish more people mentioned this in their reviews more often to compare compatibility. I think this set would work best for an Android device, imo.My first set stopped working on the second day I used them, they were gimmicked, so Amazon did a quick replacement for me. The new pair worked better.Pros: amazing quality soundComfortableComes with a nice caseThey're lightweightPrice worth getting vs name brandsGreat battery life (headphones) *see consCons: they suddenly disconnect at random sometimes, and then i have to reconnect to my BT device.

Baseus Inspire XH1 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones,Baseus,"I'm normally an ear bud user. With earbuds I was getting tired of the fear of them falling out on the plane if I fall asleep. I saw these  with sound by Bose and was interested. These a feature heavy for the price. Dolby audio/ spatial audio, transparency mode and noise cancelling.  Long battery life. Dual connect. LDAC support. I think you can get any kind of sound you like out of these. Clear vocals, bass heavy, balanced, etc. Used on a 5hr plane ride and noise cancellation blocked out airplane noise and loud conversations that were being had on the row behind me. Transparency mode made it to were I could hear the announcements clearly without taking the headphones off. The app is easy to use to control and change settings on the headphones. The physical buttons are easy to find. The headphones fit me well with absolutely no discomfort while wearing them. Good build quality. 10hrs of use with noise cancellation and transparency mode and it was only on 80% battery. Playing at full volume there is no distortion in the sound. I will probably use these solely for travel and commuting. I tried a different set of headphones from baseus, the Bowie MH1. The Bowie MH1 didn't perform as good as the InSpire XH1. I Could tell the sound quality in the XH1 was clearly superior to the Bowie MH1 instantly. But for their price they both were good. For $150 these are really good.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli 2i Fit Open-Ear Headphones,Baseus,"These are actually surprisingly nice. To be clear, I ordered them because they were cheap and it's nice to have a set in my car for when I'm stuck waiting at a doctors appointment or something. When I ordered them I did not notice they were ""open ear"" fit. Unlike most headphones of this type they do not actually have a rubber earbud tip that goes in your ear. These are actually just a speaker that sits over your ear. At first this struck me as a cheap design meant to cut costs but this is actually surprisingly pleasant. I feel they are more comfortable. The ear buds that go in my ear can be irritating after wearing them a while. These you almost forget your wearing. I like that they do not completely block out other sounds around you so can hear whats going on around you. Now you might say well but I don't want to hear all the noise around me I want to hear what I'm listening too! Because the speakers are physically over your ear they do block outside sounds notably just not as completely as say a conventional earbud does. I can still hear when someone calls my name or when the alarm on my cook timer goes off but outside sounds are not so much such that  I find it disruptive to what I am listening to. I also love the Bluetooth connection reliability! I'm not sure what the honest range is because I've worn these around the house while my phone was left on the charger and never had the connection break up. I've tested it at least 20-30 feet through walls in other rooms. That's pretty good by my experience with cheap earbuds. The only thing I do not like is the charge indicator on the base unit. It's just a single LED that blinks. There is no percentage bar or battery life indicator. It could be nearly dead or mostly charged I have no idea. This is particularly bad as the batteries for the base are kind of small and it has left me with dead headphones and a dead base that wasn't charging them unknown to me. I also kind of hate the case. It's kind of oval shaped and the top half has a ridge you can grip onto to open the lid but the lower half is curved and smooth leaving you nothing to grip onto. It's unnecessarily difficult and annoying to open and has caused me to drop it several times. For the money I think they are great. They fit well, they sound good, they are cheap, reliable. They represent a great value and I have bought a few pairs just to wear around the house while I'm doing chores or take to work.EDIT: So there is one more thing I want to add to these. I live in a colder climate and typically when I have to shovel snow I like to put in earbuds on so I can listen to something while I work. The problem is I also have to wear a hat that covers my ears to keep warm. Because the elastic puts pressure on the earbuds the classical style earbud gets jammed into my ear canal and is very uncomfortable borderline painful. I either have to take the earbuds out or wear my hat so it doesn't cover my ears which is at best uncomfortably cold and at worst leaves me vulnerable to frostbite, no joke or exaggeration there. These earbuds that just have speakers over the ear and do not actually go into the ear canal can be comfortably worn with a winter hat fully covering my ear. This is a HUGE benefit for poor souls like me who have to work outside in cold climates. Again this seemed like a cheap design at first but I'm increasingly finding I actually like it a lot better than the classic earbud design.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Baseus Eli 2i Fit Open-Ear Headphones,Baseus,"I've had mixed experiences with Baseus earphones before; I usually love them but find them to be less durable than I'd like.In this case, knock on wood, not only have I found the sound good and the battery life excellent, they've held up very well to extended use in sweaty conditions. Unlike earbuds that get inserted into the ear, I'm a lot less likely to wind up fostering an ear infection or winding up with part of an earbud stuck in my ear.These are also very comfortable. Eventually, I do need to adjust them, but I can forget I'm wearing them for an hour or more. They're very light.I love that they're USBC and charge with the same charger as my other devices. The case has additional battery that adds an extra couple of sessions of charging in reserve.If there's one thing I'd change, I find it hard to open the charging case sometimes. This isn't a big design issue, but it could use a slightly larger lip for people with short nails to use to open the case.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Baseus Eli 2i Fit Open-Ear Headphones,Baseus,"These are fine. Decent sound and battery life, especially for the price (under $20).  However, with that lower price comes some pretty noticeable cons.

Bose QuietComfort Headphones,Bose,"First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5’s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don’t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort’s buttons to the Ultra’s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45’s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45’s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5’s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm’s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5’s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they’re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45’s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose’s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don’t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45’s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they’re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don’t work out, but I would imagine they’d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45’s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5’s require using the app, the Sonos don’t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don’t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I’ve found that to be accurate.  While that’s less than the Sonos and Sony’s battery life (30 hours), it’s more than the Apple’s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45’s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there’s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you’re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Headphones,Bose,"I bought the ultras on the black friday sale last week and while the noise cancellation was amazing, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the features in the app, the touch volume control on the side, the heavy headset, etc. I decided to try these out and I’m SO glad I did. Personally I find these way more comfortable on my head and I think they’re a bit lighter. The noise cancellation is still great - the ultras maybe block out 5% more but have that hissing NC noise way louder which I didn’t like. This still blocks out sound really well and plenty enough for me. I’m not on flights or in loud places that often so for me it’s more about blocking out background noise at home which it does excellently. If you don’t need the spatial audio, immersion modes, extreme NC, and high tech features of the ultra I honestly would go with these. They were much cheaper (got these on cyber monday sale and were nearly $150 less than the ultras) and I personally prefer them. Love the simple and user friendly controls too. I’m a millennial and good with tech, but sometimes it’s too much and too gimmicky. These are great though and you can really tell a difference between the aware and quiet modes. It’s very nice having that option. I hope they last for years to come!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Headphones,Bose,"I’m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a “general audience’s” needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose Ultra Open Earbuds,Bose,"Usually I say they are good for what it’s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro’s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won’t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can’t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I’m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I’m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose Ultra Open Earbuds,Bose,"i've bought and tried so many of these types of open style earbuds.  the anker c40s, shokz openfit 2, powerbeats pro 2 (not open but similar style), edifier lolliclip, soundpeats pealclip pro, and the list goes on.  I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.  The best low cost alternative I tried are the Soundpeats pearl clips - great value for the money.  For call quality, it wasn't a huge priority for me.  The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.  Would be nice to maybe have better water and/or dust resistance...",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II,Bose,"Lets start with sound quality. Sound quality is very good. As the volume goes up, the quality stays the same.Battery life. I will say the battery life is good. My volume stays around 30% with active noise cancelling on and I get 6 hours per charge.A. N.C. ( active noise cancelling ). ANC is very good. I use it all the time at work on the transparency mode. Helps loud noise from being so rough on my ears but if it's really loud I will hear it pop in the buds. On quite mode is something even today I have a hard time adjusting to. It cuts out so much noise that when I take the buds out my ears, my brain has to adjust back to all the back ground noise again.Stability connections. Connecting Bluetooth when I first got the buds was easy but now is a whole new story. I have had one bud drop out of connection and the reconnect 3-5 minutes later. I have even had it were the buds was not insync with the sound.Comfort. I will say for myself I can wear the buds for a long period of time. The hardest part for me now is getting that tone in my ear to let me know it's a good fit in my ear. I have slept several times with them in my ears.App. This is where I think my biggest problem is with these buds. The app has a hand full of options and nothing impressive. You use the app to update the buds but the last update I believe gave me all my problems.So I say yes these are very good buds but nothing to go break the bank to get.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones,Bose,"First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5’s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don’t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort’s buttons to the Ultra’s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45’s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45’s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5’s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm’s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5’s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they’re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45’s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose’s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don’t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45’s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they’re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don’t work out, but I would imagine they’d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45’s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5’s require using the app, the Sonos don’t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don’t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I’ve found that to be accurate.  While that’s less than the Sonos and Sony’s battery life (30 hours), it’s more than the Apple’s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45’s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there’s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you’re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones,Bose,"I bought the ultras on the black friday sale last week and while the noise cancellation was amazing, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the features in the app, the touch volume control on the side, the heavy headset, etc. I decided to try these out and I’m SO glad I did. Personally I find these way more comfortable on my head and I think they’re a bit lighter. The noise cancellation is still great - the ultras maybe block out 5% more but have that hissing NC noise way louder which I didn’t like. This still blocks out sound really well and plenty enough for me. I’m not on flights or in loud places that often so for me it’s more about blocking out background noise at home which it does excellently. If you don’t need the spatial audio, immersion modes, extreme NC, and high tech features of the ultra I honestly would go with these. They were much cheaper (got these on cyber monday sale and were nearly $150 less than the ultras) and I personally prefer them. Love the simple and user friendly controls too. I’m a millennial and good with tech, but sometimes it’s too much and too gimmicky. These are great though and you can really tell a difference between the aware and quiet modes. It’s very nice having that option. I hope they last for years to come!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones,Bose,"I’m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a “general audience’s” needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2.

In the last two years I've had four pairs of Bose headphones and all of them have failed in some manner. Now the latest, after FOUR MONTHS, have failed too. Now the left headphone will only go up to abut 2/3 volume and past that only the right headphone increases in volume leaving the sound completely unbalanced and coming from the right ear.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Earbuds,Bose,"I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)I went with these two because1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.Let's start with jlabI'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..Bose.Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???How do they sound so much better?!I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale. I would like to have them in my collection for when I just need some good headbanging. Both headphones are great, but get the one you need for the life you live. Take care!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Earbuds,Bose,"I rarely write reviews, due to lack of time and the fact that if a product performs the way it's supposed to, it doesn't deserve my time to review it. For the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, I will make an exception.Simply put, they are wonderful - the sound, the noise cancelling, the ease of fit and comfort.  A solid product all around.  I have never been a big Bose fan.  I thought their products were good, but not great and overpriced.  I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace my old faithful Jabra 65T Elites that finally died. They were nearly 4 years old and didn't owe me anything.  Based on reviews, I tried the Apple AirPod Pro 2nd gen, the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose.I was interested in the AirPods mostly because of their compatibility with my Iphone and my son's recommendation. I returned them for three reasons.  First, to get them to fit with a tight seal was an ordeal.  Fifteen minutes of futzing around to finally pass the seal test (and that's with Comply foam tips -- the Apple silicone tips didn't work for me period.) And even after passing the seal test, I did not find the ANC particularly effective.  Adjusting the volume by sliding my finger up and down the stem was wonky -- not working, pausing the music or shifting the bud, the seal I worked so hard to get, broke. Also, not having a real equalizer is a drawback. Apple has a customization wizard, but I like to have different settings for different genres of music.  The customization wizard uses Apple's own sound track.On to the Sony's.  I liked the Sony's.  I have the WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones for serious listening and they are great.  But they are not suitable to wear for dog walking, bike rides or the gym.  I need earbuds.  The over the ears are also bulky to take on airplane flights taking up a lot real estate in my string pack or messenger bag. Anyway, I tried the 1000XM5's and liked them.  The sound is very good as is the ANC.  The three drawbacks are ease of fit, comfort and volume control.  While easier to pass the seal fit test than the apples, it still took more futzing around than I care to do. Also, to pass the seal test, I had to use the large tips which hurt my ears after an hour.  Finally, the four tap volume control is a pain.  I either got know response or went back a track because I only tapped three times.So on to the Bose. Nirvana.Fit and Comfort.  So easy to get a fit with their innovative tip and wing combo.  The wings are really a small silicone gasket that fit inside your ear, but outside the ear canal. Select the right combo of tip and wing (sized independently) put them in your ear and you pass the fit test, first time, every time.  I hardly feel them in my ears.Sound Quality.  Superb. The Bose bathe me with aural warmth.  I liked the Sony sound until I listened to the Bose.  I would characterize the sound as warm but accurate.  The Sony sound is like sunlight.  The Bose sound is like an incandescent lamp.  Despite the warmth, the sound is always clean and bright when it needs to be.  I listen to a very wide range of music and the sound has been great for every genre. I think that classical music really tests the quality of an audio product due to the tonal range of instruments and voices and the variety of textures.  Listening to Mozart's Requiem was sublime. It was like falling in love all over again.  The immersion sound option raises the sound quality to a whole new level, bringing a depth and presence to the music. Just wow. And unlike the spatial music technology of Sony and Apple, immersion works for all sources. What I said about Mozart applies to any rock, jazz, and Latin that I have thrown out them. I've heard sounds, I've never heard before. The Bose app has a basic equalizer but I leave everything flat.ANC:  Can't be beat.  I can listen to quiet music while my wife is watching TV and it doesn't bother me.  Sharp sounds such as a firecracker breakthrough but it's not a sensory deprivation chamber after all.  I remember the early days of ANC -- it deadened the sound.  Not these buds.  The sound is alive and well.  Can't wait to take them on my first flight in two weeks.  And the aware mode is terrific.  Just switch to aware and have a conversation without taking the buds out or when using them while on a bike ride.Controls:  Work really well and sliding you finger to increase/decrease volume is easy, unlike my experience with the AirPod Pros.  I learned that the double and triple taps to move forwards and backwards between tracks does not have to be super rapid. Overall, the touch controls work as well as the physical controls of my old Jabra's.Phone calls: Very secondary for me but so far they have worked just fine.  I hear voices clearly and it seems that I am easily understood.Battery Life -- The only weakness- 4 hours with immersion on but I'm told with moderate volume, you can eke out 5 hours, enough for a cross country flight. And I will keep my over the ear Sony's up top in my carry on if I need them.  I am not too concerned.  Not concerned enough to take take a star off.Everybody's tastes are different.  Some folks will be wed to Apple and it's ecosystem and the buds are $50 less.  Sony has better battery life.  But for me, Bose wins hands down for the combination of fit, comfort, sound quality, ANC and controls.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II,Bose,"These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a ""beep"" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II,Bose,"I work in a dental lab and I have bad noise sensitivity issues. Bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other ear buds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did and good lord the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block SO MUCH. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and the cool little bands they have around the bud keeps them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh NOTHING. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (android). They are VERY sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip or go back.Music and audio books sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had including Sony's has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace.On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it and twice it stopped syncing.  I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud so if I was taking the left one out first ( I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right on out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the, battery at blah blah percent prompt then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in and I have never had another problem and I waited a over solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life altering product that has made an ENORMOUS difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of NOISE.On battery life. At work I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me.  I am there for 9 hours.In my opinion these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Ultra True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbuds,Bose,"I use to have airpod pros, so when it comes to these in my opinion there is no comparison these are simply better. So they are a little bulky (i have small ears, but they fit me pretty good) and they are suprisingly quite comfortable, thankfully it comes with different size eartips so adjustment is there.ANC is on these is actually crazy i can't hear a thing when it's on i've tried other earbuds these are fantastic, Aware mode is really good too no complaints. The audio quality is extremely good the app comes with an eq so that's good (app is slow tho haha)  the modes are insane too except immersive i personally didn't like it on these earbuds, i don't know if it's a new feature on these earphones but to me it ain't it.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbuds,Bose,"- Amazon-renewed version fails often: 4 pairs in less than 6 months. Technically 5 because semi-last shipment mysteriously was a children's $5 item rather than my headphones.- Requires Bose app which is NOT privacy-friendly per my analysis of the app's internet connection data.- Has ongoing microphone issues: bad quality/static during many calls. Well known to Bose for years. No fixes available.- This 5th pair is ""Josh's headphones"". Tells me everything I suspected about Amazon's refurbishing quality. At least there's no earwax, so... 2 stars I guess.Pros: best ANC, period. Silences even people's voices and actually negates common sounds in the real world, unlike my experience with Google Buds Pro 2. ANC is even better than the Sony WF-1000XM5, which are even more expensive.Moral of the story: wifi headphones are a mess.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbuds,Bose,"Disaster ... I lost my apple earpods.  Looked everywhere and can not find them.  So, shopped for a replacement.  Came across these Bose earbuds, and did some deep research on them.  I really did not especially want to pay this much for a new set of earbuds, but I have always been impressed with any Bose product I have used in the past.  Found the ""renewed"" buds, so decided to give it a try.  Here are some things to know ... these are the best earbuds I have ever used.  Period.  Extremely comfortable.  And the overall sound is unlike anything I have used in the past.  It is deep, rich sound.  Great bass.  And the ""immersion"" setting puts you right in the middle of the band.  Plus, it has the best noise cancelation feature I have ever used.  I simply love these buds.  Only downside is ... the description says it comes with the ""fit kit"" so you can get just the right fit.  This is a lie.  No instructions.  No fit kit.  Just the case, buds and a short cable.  And there is no way I could find to contact the seller.  So, I contacted Bose, and they sent me out a fit kit for free.  But what a hassle.  I would have knocked a star off for it, except it is not the earbud's issue, it is the seller.  And these earbuds will change your life.  Totally worth the big bucks.***UPDATE*** 11/27/24:  I continue to love the earbuds for regular use, but have knocked down my rating to 3 stars.  Reason being that I have learned that when making or receiving a phone call, the earbuds are next to worthless.  The sound quality is very faint and it is hard to hear the caller.  Researched this on Google, and this appears to be a very common issue without an easy solution.  I will be calling Bose to see if they can help with it or to exchange this headset for one that functions correctly.  Very disappointing.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Ultra True Wireless Noise Cancelling In-Ear Earbuds,Bose,"Simply put, these are the best in-ear bluetooth phones I have. I know that for some people they sound too bass-heavy but that's exactly what I was looking for. Sony and Sennheiser are more natural but I like my music punchy.In calls they are just as perfect.Connection stability is supreme, control are very easy because the touch zone covers the whole earbud.Comfy and not jotting out like Sony's or Jabra's. Running on treadmill at 11 speed and no tilt.Immersive mode is brilliant. Noise canceling is the best I've ever seen. My desktop computer sounds like a Boeing Jet when I do renders or post production but as soon as I put on my Bose's, all is calm and quiet. In ""aware"" mode, I can still clearly hear outside world with a lowered volume and listen to my music to my heart's desire. I used aware mode in my band practice jam sessions and I can clearly distinguish and hear both the track in my ears and my own drum playing.That said, if you are looking for in-ear monitors, go for Shure. Like I said these are pretty bass-heavy so you won't be hearing your songs as others probably will.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Now the left headphone will only go up to abut 2/3 volume and past that only the right headphone increases in volume leaving the sound completely unbalanced and coming from the right ear.

Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen),Bose,"I've used many, many different pairs of earbuds. Most with active noise cancellation, and I can honestly say these are the best by a mile! I used them in a variaty of enviroments from a noisy office space, on a plan, and at home with the constant noise of my kids and their toys. Every time you put them in your ears, you're presented with a symponic sound that tunes the earbuds and checks the seal to your ear. It helps make the noise canceling feature work the best I've ever heard! I have a white noise machine that helps my wife sleep at night, and these buds can block out that sound 100% on its loudest setting! That way, when she's trying to sleep, I can watch some streaming content without the sound of anything in the background, making it easy to hear the smallest sound in what you're watching, like someone breathing in a quiet, tense moment, even when there's a bunch of noise all around you. The Bose app is great too! it makes it easy to customize the use of the earbuds, manage the devices they are connected to, and adjust the EQ and noise cancellation feature. The spartial audio feature makes it seem like you are listening in a large concert hall vs. a set of earbuds. You must try it when you get your pair! You can find it in the ""immersion"" menu in the Bose app on your phone. The earbuds fit very securely in your ear. There are enough fit pieces in the box to fit almost any ear shape. I love that the V2 has so many colors to choose from. I went with the black/gold version, and I love the way they look! overall, I give these a 5/5! well worh the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen),Bose,"I have an Android phone and I was using a different earbuds which unfortunately Im unable to use all the features it touted. So I needed an earbuds that aside from comfort I'm able to use all capabilities. I've had other Bose products and I was fairly confident that Bose wouldn't let me down. I'm happy to say that yay, I got my money's worth! The sound quality was impressive and the sample audio clip that Bose had during the setup phase really showed that off. I like that it had all these different features in there, Still Immersion, etc. So of course, I listed to my own songs and it was great. Noise cancelling was superb in my honest opinion. I heard the difference when it is on and off. I didn't hear my Mom when she was talking with the earbuds on and I'm like duh! i have the earbuds on lol. This was without any sound on so my Mom's voice was so distant and far away. I also tested the Bose with my work laptop as I conduct video meetings and again I'm very happy with it. My coworkers did not complain that they couldn't hear me so it looks like the mic placement in the Bose is great. I'm happy to no longer use my big headphones with the sticking out microphone. By the way, the Bose was Bluetooth connected to my two devices, my Android Phone and work laptop and there was no issue to start using the work laptop for the video meetings so that was very convenient. In regard to fit, I did not change the pads. It looks like medium is my size, and so far, I have not experienced any pain in my ear from wearing it too long. I've had it on for about an hour. I will have to continue to observe if I experience any pain if I wear it for more than an hour. The case itself is pretty portable, in my opinion, and it is not slippery — which I love because I don’t feel the need to purchase a case cover. This uses a USB-C and has wireless charging, and both so far have worked flawlessly. In conclusion, I totally recommend these Bose earbuds. I am using it for both work and personal reasons and so Im definitely getting the bang out of my buck.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds,Bose,"These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds,Bose,"These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds,Bose,"First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I’ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I’ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem – only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they’re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I’ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I’ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to “stay alive”.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it’s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",1.0 out of 5 stars

I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Earbuds,Bose,"These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Earbuds,Bose,"First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I’ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I’ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem – only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they’re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I’ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I’ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to “stay alive”.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it’s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds,Bose,"I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)I went with these two because1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.Let's start with jlabI'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..Bose.Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???How do they sound so much better?!I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale. I would like to have them in my collection for when I just need some good headbanging. Both headphones are great, but get the one you need for the life you live. Take care!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds,Bose,"I rarely write reviews, due to lack of time and the fact that if a product performs the way it's supposed to, it doesn't deserve my time to review it. For the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, I will make an exception.Simply put, they are wonderful - the sound, the noise cancelling, the ease of fit and comfort.  A solid product all around.  I have never been a big Bose fan.  I thought their products were good, but not great and overpriced.  I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace my old faithful Jabra 65T Elites that finally died. They were nearly 4 years old and didn't owe me anything.  Based on reviews, I tried the Apple AirPod Pro 2nd gen, the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose.I was interested in the AirPods mostly because of their compatibility with my Iphone and my son's recommendation. I returned them for three reasons.  First, to get them to fit with a tight seal was an ordeal.  Fifteen minutes of futzing around to finally pass the seal test (and that's with Comply foam tips -- the Apple silicone tips didn't work for me period.) And even after passing the seal test, I did not find the ANC particularly effective.  Adjusting the volume by sliding my finger up and down the stem was wonky -- not working, pausing the music or shifting the bud, the seal I worked so hard to get, broke. Also, not having a real equalizer is a drawback. Apple has a customization wizard, but I like to have different settings for different genres of music.  The customization wizard uses Apple's own sound track.On to the Sony's.  I liked the Sony's.  I have the WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones for serious listening and they are great.  But they are not suitable to wear for dog walking, bike rides or the gym.  I need earbuds.  The over the ears are also bulky to take on airplane flights taking up a lot real estate in my string pack or messenger bag. Anyway, I tried the 1000XM5's and liked them.  The sound is very good as is the ANC.  The three drawbacks are ease of fit, comfort and volume control.  While easier to pass the seal fit test than the apples, it still took more futzing around than I care to do. Also, to pass the seal test, I had to use the large tips which hurt my ears after an hour.  Finally, the four tap volume control is a pain.  I either got know response or went back a track because I only tapped three times.So on to the Bose. Nirvana.Fit and Comfort.  So easy to get a fit with their innovative tip and wing combo.  The wings are really a small silicone gasket that fit inside your ear, but outside the ear canal. Select the right combo of tip and wing (sized independently) put them in your ear and you pass the fit test, first time, every time.  I hardly feel them in my ears.Sound Quality.  Superb. The Bose bathe me with aural warmth.  I liked the Sony sound until I listened to the Bose.  I would characterize the sound as warm but accurate.  The Sony sound is like sunlight.  The Bose sound is like an incandescent lamp.  Despite the warmth, the sound is always clean and bright when it needs to be.  I listen to a very wide range of music and the sound has been great for every genre. I think that classical music really tests the quality of an audio product due to the tonal range of instruments and voices and the variety of textures.  Listening to Mozart's Requiem was sublime. It was like falling in love all over again.  The immersion sound option raises the sound quality to a whole new level, bringing a depth and presence to the music. Just wow. And unlike the spatial music technology of Sony and Apple, immersion works for all sources. What I said about Mozart applies to any rock, jazz, and Latin that I have thrown out them. I've heard sounds, I've never heard before. The Bose app has a basic equalizer but I leave everything flat.ANC:  Can't be beat.  I can listen to quiet music while my wife is watching TV and it doesn't bother me.  Sharp sounds such as a firecracker breakthrough but it's not a sensory deprivation chamber after all.  I remember the early days of ANC -- it deadened the sound.  Not these buds.  The sound is alive and well.  Can't wait to take them on my first flight in two weeks.  And the aware mode is terrific.  Just switch to aware and have a conversation without taking the buds out or when using them while on a bike ride.Controls:  Work really well and sliding you finger to increase/decrease volume is easy, unlike my experience with the AirPod Pros.  I learned that the double and triple taps to move forwards and backwards between tracks does not have to be super rapid. Overall, the touch controls work as well as the physical controls of my old Jabra's.Phone calls: Very secondary for me but so far they have worked just fine.  I hear voices clearly and it seems that I am easily understood.Battery Life -- The only weakness- 4 hours with immersion on but I'm told with moderate volume, you can eke out 5 hours, enough for a cross country flight. And I will keep my over the ear Sony's up top in my carry on if I need them.  I am not too concerned.  Not concerned enough to take take a star off.Everybody's tastes are different.  Some folks will be wed to Apple and it's ecosystem and the buds are $50 less.  Sony has better battery life.  But for me, Bose wins hands down for the combination of fit, comfort, sound quality, ANC and controls.",5.0 out of 5 stars

CMF Buds 2a Wireless Earbuds 2025 New Active Noise Cancelling 42dB Hybrid ANC Bluetooth Headphones,Cmf By Nothing,"I bought these after watching current video reviews. I lucked out and got them brand new at 50% off the current retail price. They are a simple baseline model with less frills than the more expensive options such as the Pro2s. That being said they sound fantastic. The app is easy to navigate and makes them extra customizable. Battery life is fantastic. Honestly I'm completely impressed with the CMF 2a series. For a set of base model true wireless buds they lack nothing essential for music lovers. Nice build quality, stylish color optiins, and they sound awesome from the crisp clear highs down to the punchy bass filled lows.Overall a really great product that performs well for the price tag. Judging from these I'm willing to now possibly consider adding a set of Pros or choosing other CMF product purchases in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds 2a Wireless Earbuds 2025 New Active Noise Cancelling 42dB Hybrid ANC Bluetooth Headphones,Cmf By Nothing,"Should you buy these? Yes.First of all, these are an incredible value, even though I'm not sure what the actual price is. I bought a pair today for $30, curious about how well these perform despite being so cheap, considering how well-liked they are.  I tested them on a set of tracks that are unbalanced, each in their own way (e.g. too heavy on the bass/treble/etc.) and somehow they all sounded good.  I don't know how that's even possible.  These little things have bass you can feel, which I've never experienced with any kind of earbud.  It's not something that I particularly enjoy, but a lot of people will, and it's impressive nevertheless.  When I like a pair of headphones I get a backup pair, so I just bought another pair of these and they were only $20.  After I bought them they went up to $40.  All of those prices are justifiable for the quality these provide, but I am very confused why the price keeps changing on me.But let's say they're supposed to be $40.  At that price point, you wouldn't think to compare them to Sony's WF-1000XM4 or Apple's Airpods Pro 2, but they sound better than both.  It's not that hard to sound better than Airpods, but there are other features worth comparing.  Sounding better than Sony's WF-1000XM4s, however—at somewhere between 6.75% and 13.5% of the cost—is pretty incredible.  Granted, they're definitely not more realistic, but these somehow manage to make everything sound good.  Senheiser's IE 600s are for realism, but I would not argue that they sound better.  When you're listening for fun, the CMF Buds 2a are the most fun.  Normally, I prefer uncolored, realistic sound even in a headphone I use for fun, but these are a rare exception.I love trying new headphones because you get to hear your favorite music in a new way.  Sometimes it's not a huge difference, but I hear more detail than average so I enjoy the subtle stuff.  I think the sound stage of these buds elevate the sound significantly.  You can really hear the details, even in a bad mix. You can hear the sound move so well and with such fluidity.  It's just hard to believe these are $20-40 Bluetooth headphones.I've used these for only a couple of hours now, so I can't speak to battery life, but I'm hoping they truly will make it through the workday.  They're surprisingly comfortable, and the medium tips actually fit great (usually I'm a small size). I like the design. Everything's plastic—and not plastic that feels particularly sturdy—but the design is nice.  While the headphones feel like they go into the case backwards (to me, at least), they snap in thanks to magnets and look nicer in that ""backwards"" position.  The case is very small and looks nice in a minimal way. The active noise canceling is good and comparable to the WF-1000XM4s.  I think the AirPods Pro 2 win in the ANC category by a hair.If there's one place I can fault these buds is in the touch controls.  I can turn ANC on and off, but so far I haven't been sucessful with any other option.  They just don't seem to respond well to taps.  I don't really care, though.  I find touch controls useful only when I can't control the volume and track through any other mechanism.  I find it much easier to make these adjustments on my phone or computer.  Still, I would prefer if I could get the touch controls to actually work.These buds are my new recommendation for non-audiophiles, and audiophiles who want a fun pair.  They're exceptional for the price, and would still be competitive at five times the cost.  I'm really glad I decided to give these a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars

CMF Buds 2a Wireless Earbuds 2025 New Active Noise Cancelling 42dB Hybrid ANC Bluetooth Headphones,Cmf By Nothing,"I bought it on Black Friday for $20. I was not expecting much, was getting them for phone calls. Oh boy... these really caught me off-guard, they are actually very good! I have only used them as of this review less than one day, but I have been trying to make them sound as good as the BOSE QC35ii headphones I have (BOSE sound is in another league).Equalizer/Sound:Recommended Equalizer settings on Nothing app:BASS: +6MID: +1TREBLE: 0Ultra Bass: Level 5For rock, these settings are the best you can probably get (of course they still sound fantastic outside of rock). I tested these for live-streams (gaming/shooting) and voices sounded normal-good (compared to my headphones), normal songs sounded good, instrumental music (from Elden Ring) sounded very good, rock (I tested Abracadavre, a song from Call of Duty: Black Ops 1) and at around second ~0:20 where the good part starts, sounded somehow disappointing *with the default Dirac equalizer setting*, but once I tested the customized equalizer I just showed earlier it sounded MUCH better (still not even close to the BOSE headphones, but they do sound from acceptable to good now). If you combine these settings with a separate equalizer app, you can probably make these sound much better. The ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) is, like mentioned in Linus Tech Tips, pretty decent-good, it is like 1/3 the strength of the BOSE headphones (ANC from CMF does not hurt the 1st time you use it, I recall the 1st time I used the BOSE ANC that I felt being inside a submarine very deep in the ocean).Microphones during calls: sounds very clear (in a room with metal fans that make strong white noise). I tested by calling myself to another phone.Case: It fits extremely tight on the small pockets that jeans have. So far has done it's  job of charging, but since this is day 1 I will not talk about this aside of saying it works.Connection: Tested on an Asus Zephyrus G15 GA503QR (Linux Pop-OS), Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 and Google Pixel 6. In all it connects fast and stable. Sometimes increasing the volume increases more loudly one bud first but then the other bud catches up, but normally they both do it at the same time. Audio to video latency, okay-good. When I start a YouTube video the audio kicks in at like second 1-2, but after that no noticeably latency (very slight latency whenever I saw someone in a video game shoot, the sound and visual recoil of gun did not match, maybe 0.2-0.4 ms latency guesstimating by eye).Ear tip fit: pretty good, I recommend trying the large one for a better seal, so the ANC is better (not by that much).Does it fit: Yes, it does not fall off at all, can sleep while wearing them comfortably (sleeping on the side).Is this worth it? Yes (in my case, for $20 this was a steal), but I will suggest looking the Plus version of these earbuds since (I believe, please check first) the equalizer settings on the Nothing app for that earbud is much more detailed and advanced, also you can modify how strong you want the ANC to be (and has like personalized audio, whatever that means). The CMF Buds 2 Plus is $80 and CMF Buds 2A $50, so if you see the Plus in discount closer to $50 I suggest you get those; otherwise Buds 2A for less than $30 is very good deal (both are reviewed in Short Circuit channel on YouTube). Pretty satisfied.Updated 12/7/25:1. Bluetooth range: Much better than my Bose, very surprised.2. Battery life is very good, was in a call for like 2 hours and still had like 65% I believe.3. This supports the feature that Airpods have of ""seamlessly"" connecting between multiple devices and switching fast (I have not tried it, but you need the Nothing app to enable it.Annoyances:1. No way to disable hang up calls and other call specific touch gestures. I accidentally hung up a call trying to adjust my buds.2. The touch sensor is VERY sensitive, and... essentially the WHOLE stick of the bud is detected by the sensors, so just adjusting them at the tip (the opposite side of the sensor's location) will still hang up the call, so be careful.3. If bud slides off your ear, use a smaller size. For me small size prevents them from falling off.So far very good and solid performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds with Smart Dial,Cmf By Nothing,"The CMF Buds Pro 2 really surprised me with how good they are. The sound quality is crisp with deep bass, and the LDAC support makes a noticeable difference. The 50dB hybrid noise cancelling works extremely well — it blocks out gym noise, traffic, and background chatter easily. I love the smart dial on the case; it makes volume and switching modes super convenient. Battery life is excellent too, and the fast charging is a big plus. For this price, these earbuds feel like a premium product. Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds with Smart Dial,Cmf By Nothing,"I wasn't expecting these to be bad by any means, but they are certainly better than I had expected. Sound quality isn't as good as my KZ PR1, which isn't a surprise, but otherwise they are a very solid sounding earbud. I love the case, the knob is a nice feature, maybe a bit gimmicky, but it works and I use it all the time. The battery lasts me easily a whole day at work, which is 10 hours. I could likely go a week without charging them. I don't use the noise cancelling, but the transparent mode works well. The app is pretty nice too, good amount of customization and all around a solid experienceFor context on sound quality - I listen to mostly heavy metal, so very loud and constant music, and they handle it just fine. The bass never feels stressed or like it's distorting(I have the bass boost on its lowest setting), and the mids and highs are clear enough. I don't ever listen at more than about 50% volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds with Smart Dial,Cmf By Nothing,"Out of the box, these sound shockingly good. Like stuff you get from $100-$180 pairs good. Pair that with a really nice feature set, a good app and EQ control, then you have one great value set of buds right here. It's light and have a really good seal that didn't fall out of my ears even while sprinting on a treadmill.Speaking of the app and EQ, it is heavily recommended you use their app. Not only to have access to many of the features, but to also tame theses buds a bit. While the vocals and separation are quite well tunned, they are also tuned heavily towards bass and its treble is a bit high for my taste. Sadly, the app only lets you control Bass, Mids, Treble, so attempting to tame that bass also affects the sub-bass.  Still, my issue with it is mostly due to the genre of music I listen to causing me to constantly reach for my phone to tune that EQ to keep it from being fatiguing. But if you listen to genres that love that type of sound signature, like EDM or Hip-Hop, then these would sound perfect as that extra bass does help those genres sound extra punchy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds with Smart Dial,Cmf By Nothing,"Use these daily as a landscaper, they are not rated for water but they regularly have gotten wet with no adverse effects! They sound just as good if not better than my Pixel buds Pro they replaced. The noise cancellation is better in most cases. I ride motorcycles and they fit well inside a helmet and have superior noise cancelling when it comes to wind noise compared to the Pixel Buds Pro! The Case is very handy while riding or working as well, being able to remotely turn down the volume or program your own responses on  the buttons is wonderful. Battery life and overall connectivity is great, they last most of a whole days work at volume they should probably not be at and I have often walked away from my phone and forgotten about it unfortunately!Value for the Dollar, It is incredibly hard to beat these.I use Sony WH1000MX4s for noise cancellation while sitting at a deskI use Skullcandy Skullcrushers while working outAnd these while working outside or not wanting to use over the ear headphones they have replaced my WF1000XM3s, and my Pixel Buds Pro.If you cant tell I like listening to music of different varieties. And these work well as all rounder headphones with great ANC (no it wont beat over the ear headphones) but its still great! Helps when working with large machinery too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CMF Buds Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds with Smart Dial,Cmf By Nothing,"The sound is good, the fit is good, the case is really cool, and it has functionality. The CMF Buds Pro 2 are earbuds that I never expected to purchase this year, and I was shocked by the sound quality.Last year, I purchased the first generation of CMF Buds. The result: subpar sound quality, not that bassy, and I was disappointed. I returned them and thought to never purchase CMF Buds again, until now.The CMF Buds Pro 2 are different earbuds. The case is a decent size, not AirPods-like but that smart dial is really addicting to fidget with and it is really helpful when your phone is in your pocket. You can simply twist the dial to roate volume which is great.Bluetooth connectivity works well, no issues. LDAC is supported but for me I don't really use LDAC that much. I have also talked about how LDAC never really means it is ""better"" but my ears don't like the sound of LDAC. It has dual pair so I can pair both my earbuds and laptop which is good; however, for Windows, you may experience a glitch where the earbuds are near unusable. You have to go to settings and disable a certain feature. It is a common glitch with Windows and Bluetooth devices, not a fault of the CMF Buds.For the sound quality, I was surprised by the default tuning. The Dirac Opteo tuning sounded really good for my ears. Vocals are indeed clear, and instrumentals are really good too. The spatial audio, while it doesn't have any head-tracking, enhances the sound quality. The sound feels more open, and when listening to music, it is relatively enjoyable. From rock songs to rap, the default sound signature is really well tuned (again, for my ears, you may think something different). There is a bass slider, which is cool, and I set that to Level 1. It doesn't distort sound at all and makes the listening experience much more enjoyable. Dirac Opteo is indeed more bass-focused; many earbuds around this category focus on bass (Skullcandy, JBL, Samsung, etc). However, even with this bass-focused sound profile, vocals do sound clear, and instruments sound clear as well, not overpowering vocals; however, in certain songs, instruments can sometimes overpower vocals. The other EQ profiles do not sound well in my opinion, and the custom equalizer should be improved. The weight of the actual earbuds is fairly light, and they are comfortable. The case is portable and can fit in your pocket well.Even with the bassy sound signature, the sound, in my opinion, suits me. I think many people would enjoy the sound quality. The app is also really well-made, better than Soundpeats' application, as well as Skullcandy's. Great job on the Nothing team for developing a really well-made budget pair of earbuds (with a cool case).",5.0 out of 5 stars

I work from home, work out, and love relaxing with my music without any hassle. The problem is that my ears are very sensitive, and most earbuds become uncomfortable after a short time. I needed something light, with good sound, and above all, that I could wear for hours without pain.That's when I found these professional Bluetooth earbuds. From the moment I opened the box, I knew the comfort was real. They have an ergonomic design and come with different ear tips, which allowed me to find the perfect fit.

Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Ear Buds Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones with 80H Playback Wireless Charging Case & Dual LED Display Over Ear Hooks Earphones for Sports Running Gym Workout Black,Golrex,"Earbuds, without ear hooks, don’t work for me.  They fall out at inopportune times, like when I’m mowing the yard.  Unfortunately, most ear hooks aren’t comfortable.  GOLREX has solved that problem.  These earbuds are actually comfortable and they easily adjust so that the bud fits in my ear.  I am using the medium size ear tips that were installed at the factory.Pairing was quick and simple.  But if you are like me and have several earbuds and earphones, it is important to remember that you find these on your Bluetooth connection options with the name “T59”.  If you forget, it is the model number printed on the bottom of the case.  The sound quality is excellent.I used them today while riding my lawn tractor.  The 30dB Active Noise Cancelling feature is inadequate to totally block that much noise, but I was able to listen to music.  Actually, I believe that having only 30 dB of noise reduction is actually a safety feature.  It is enough allow to more me to clearly hear, but allow me to be aware of my surroundings.For me, the charging case provides 40 hours of operation, not 80, because I always use both buds whenever I use them. But, if you use them for phone calls, alternating earbuds will in fact give you 80 hours of continuous use.The designers of the GOLREX earbuds have thought of everything and packed great features into these buds.Overall, these are a great addition to my accessories.  The price is fair, but with the current 50% off coupon, it is a great price.Oh, and by the way, don’t forget to register your purchase and you get a lifetime warranty!",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Live Beam 3,Jbl,"Incredible ear buds. I’ve purchased a ton of Soundcore stuff recently for their features and varieties and a long history of Apple AirPods and Beats studios, Monster, etc. Ear buds were basically a disposable thing to pop into my ears. I found that none of the soundcore variety stayed in my ears all too well which is a big deal since active noise cancelling (ANC) is a frequently sought out industry standard. Plus, no one seems to be able to hear me when I use them. Oh and I had one of there over the ear headphones, Q40s or something? Sounded great, ANC was impressive. Fell off my head once, and cracked. What a waste.So I decide to spend slightly more money and took advantage of a Black Friday sale. $150 later and some homework: I was looking to the Tour Pro 2s and 3s and found that the Live Beam 3s were meant to replace the Tour 2s, I decided to give these a try.First off, they’re a bit larger in the main housing so they snug to my ear better unconditional of the silicone tip size. Once I selected the smaller silicone tip, it was the most accurate fit I’ve had to date of anything I’ve tried in ear. Even better? Download the app and it will detect how effective your seal is. WHAT!I’m an audiophile in that I like good sounding music and that I believe very few thing will ever beat the organic sound of vinyl, but I won’t tell you why you need to hear a wider spectrum than 20hz to 20Khz - sorry. But they sound amazing. It’s full. It’s clear. It’s bright.Features. Features. Features. I think these have definitely set a standard in UI controlled feature set. The app is touted as one of the best and most of the feature you will frequent the app for you can do right on the cases’ built in screen. So friggin’ cool.People have argued that the ANC allows some noise to bleed through and although I understand where they’re coming from I find it to be 97% acceptable. I don’t expect to have padded room mind bending silence and I don’t know what I would do with that kind of isolation. The ambient mode allows me to keep my buds in and still not be anti social. There a cool smart talk feature that when you begin to talk it can set a period where it switches immediately to an ambient talk through mode so you can maintain your interaction interruption free. I turn it off but, how thoughtful!All in all. I’m still being wowed by this. And oh, people can hear me talk now! I also own the JBL Live 770NC. My friend has the Bose Quietcomfort headphones and side by side I think mine decimate hers. The deal breaker? She was in LaGuardia airport and I couldn’t make out a single thing she was saying. It sounded like the headphones were left under a blanket and she was whispering in the corner of the very room. For double the price, that’s shameful.I think JBL is cranking out some heat. I wouldn’t be surprised if you can get only what you can afford and if it says JBL you’ll be content.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Live Beam 3,Jbl,"Atrocious product, DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.  You have been warned.The headphones worked for about 2 months, conveniently past the refund window, before the left headphone was no longer being recognized after a failed update.  Updates require both headphones to be connected to your phone via Bluetooth, and factory resets require both headphones to be in sync with each other.  Once an update causes a problem, or if one of the headphones gets out of sync because the case isn't charging it, it will stop working and you cannot salvage it.  We've tried literally everything, including unsuccessful factory resets, different devices, etc. but it's just done, they no longer work.  We reached out to JBL support and, after giving us the standard troubleshooting options (and a half hour of our time) they disconnected on us.  Online help directed us to the ""JBL Firmware Update"" app that would resolve our issues, however that app is not available in the United States according to the Google Play Store. The next two attempts to connect to customer service resulted in additional disconnects without help, just repeating the same troubleshooting steps that we had already tried.Before this, there were other issues too.  You can't disable ALL touch inputs which means that every time you need to adjust them (which for me, was frequent even with the largest ), you have to be very careful to not accidentally tap the outside of them.  You can only use the features in the app while the headphones are connected, and never without.  The case they come with has a touch screen that out of the box, barely functions and has a lot of superfluous add-ons.  Getting the app set up and paired with your headphones can also be rather time consuming, as can the updates which require you to stay on the app's update page, all for some earbuds.  Oh, and lastly, while the audio is decent for earbuds...they certainly are not worth the money.  The noise canceling doesn't function particularly well either.I know we are not the only review complaining about this.  Don't ignore them.  Just...avoid this headache and save yourself the ridiculous amount of money this mediocre broken product asks for.  Buy literally anything else that is NOT a JBL product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune 230NC TWS,Jbl,"i used my last pair for five years, i think it was. the first thing that went was the charging - they didn't charge in the case. so i had to charge the earbuds by charging the case. then the case didn't charge as well anymore. then the battery of the earbuds declined so i only had maybe an hour of noise cancellation, which is my primary reason for using these. then they stopped pairing so well, and then ultimately one earbud stopped working altogether. so i bought another pair! these are worth buying when they're on sale the two times a year they go on sale. camelcamelcamel.com can tell you exactly by copying and pasting their URL.these have the best sound quality ever. the bass is AMAZING and makes all the difference for me. the other aspects of the quality are also incredible and the noise cancellation is the best i've tried so far. would definitely recommend - and have! my dad bought them as well, and he's very very picky about comfort. he always complains about how they fit in his ears. but he likes these and he is willing to work out with them as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Tune 230NC TWS,Jbl,"Updated 1 year later: I'm dropping my 5 stars to 4 stars. I still enjoy these headphones. And the battery is still good. After about an hour or so, my ears will start to get sore, but it's not too bad. They do cut out for about 1 sec maybe every 20 mins or so, but for the price I paid, I'm still pretty happy with them.I had not had a chance to really compare them with others until recently. We bought my dad for his birthday the Sony WF-1000XM5. They are double the price of these JBLs. He was having trouble with them so I took them for a week to find out what he was doing wrong (nothing was wrong - he wasn't wearing them correctly). While I was testing them, didn't cut out, and the sound, comfort, ambient aware and noise cancelling features were incredible. Sony's were 10x better than the JBLs.Bottom line: If you want a decent pair of noise cancelling earbuds without paying a fortune, I do believe, for the price, these JBLs are still a good buy. I liked being able to finally compare them, though, to another brand. Hope this helps.Previous post:I am super impressed with the noise canceling on these earbuds. I was looking for earbuds that had a good balance of comfort and noise cancelling and decent sound. With all the earbuds I have bought in the past I never found ones that were good at canceling the loud noise of plane engines when flying and I was always turning the sound up super loud just to hear the music. These earbuds are comfortable and did a fantastic job of canceling the background noise. I also really like the ""ambient aware"" function that allows me to turn off the noise canceling when my wife was talking next to me on the plane and I didn't have to take the earbuds out to hear her. I'm not an expert by any means, but I feel these $100 earbuds cancel out noise as well as some of the other more pricey $200-300+ over the ear brands I have played around with in stores that are big and bulky to carry around. The case is small and can fit in my pocket easily, and I can charge them while in my pocket. So when I have a layover flight, by time I got these out at my next flight gate or on the plane, they're ready to go. And I found them on sale on here for $50, which made it even better! I haven't tried these for working out or running yet so I can't say how they are with sweating and such. But for the casual wearer who would use them for something like traveling, these are DEFINITELY worth it! I highly recommend them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune 230NC TWS,Jbl,"I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldn’t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they’re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds.  Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3’s.  I’m an audiophile on a budget. They can’t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they’re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I’ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that’s due to the EQ setting I’ve selected.  You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven’t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the “ambient-aware” or “talk through” modes. That’s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don’t seem to have any functional ANC.  I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They’ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1.  However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc.  it’s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don’t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex,Jbl,"These earbuds are the best replacement for my AirPods (RIP) out of the 2 others I’ve tried. The sound quality is really good, they’ve got a good bass response and good clarity so you hear the nuances in music. I’ve tried jazz, classical, post-punk, and R&B music on them and they sound good with those, but I can’t yet say how phone calls sound bc I haven’t tried that yet. Battery life is really long, and the case almost never needs recharging! These are more versatile than the other earbuds I tried. I got them because you can use them with or without the sealing suction cup ear tip thingies. I like them without, because this way (1)they stay in place and don’t work their way loose from my ears every few minutes just like other sealing tip earbuds used to do, they let air through so they don’t make my ears all sweaty and gross, and (2)if something happens that I need to hear, I can pause the music and hear outside of the earbuds without having to fumble with taking the earbuds out. I live in a violent area and I need to be able to hear my surroundings for my own safety. The app is pretty nice, it lets you choose the functions that happen when you tap them, or even disable tapping functions, which I do sometimes so I don’t accidentally skip songs etc. just because I accidentally touched them. It also lets you adjust the EQ with presets or custom settings. It’s the first time I’ve had earbuds with an app and at first I thought it’d be dinky to have an app for my earbuds, but i changed my mind to like it because it works well and you can just set it and forget it. As for reliability, these don’t seem to have the connection issues that people on Reddit reported that they had. Maybe these are an updated model? I’ve had them for about a week and they are behaving just like any normal Bluetooth device. Pretty hassle-free. I’m happy.UPDATE: after just 11 months of light to moderate use, they are doing the thing where one bud’s battery drains from 100% to nothing in 5 minutes, they’re failing to stay disconnected from the phone even when they’re supposed to be charging . Also the case gets stuck charging to only 10%.UPDATE 2: there is a fix for this, after which the earbuds are working well again: you have to stick a few layers of little pieces of tape in the inside of the lid to make it push the buds down harder into the pins when closed, so they both charge (the problem is, the springs for the pins goes bad over time, so they don’t make good contact). Then to clear out the glitches caused by this case fiasco you have to factory reset the buds according to the quick start guide, and then do this: open the JBL app, remove the buds to make them pair to the app, then put them back in the case BUT LEAVE THE LID OPEN, then in the app tap “power off.” I’ve had no more problems since.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex,Jbl,"Update after 1.5 years:Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge.  First happened at 6 months.  Exchanged under warranty.  One year later, having the same issue.I have liked them.  They have good sound and are easy to use.  But I would not order them again.  I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models.  Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200.Side note:  JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly.Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from ""low battery"" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a ""find earphones"" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex,Jbl,"As someone who puts a lot of thought into the details that matter to everyday users, the JBL Tune Flex earbuds genuinely impressed me.What really sets these apart is the versatility. The ability to switch between sound pass-through and full noise blocking makes them incredibly adaptable—whether I’m zoning out to a playlist, locking in on an audiobook or podcast, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet without the pressure of removing the earbuds. Comfort is excellent; they’re easy to wear for extended periods without fatigue, which is something many earbuds still get wrong.Audio quality is clean, balanced, and exactly what you’d expect from JBL—reliable and satisfying across different listening styles. Battery life carries me through most of a full workday with consistent use. While I wouldn’t complain about a little extra runtime, it’s far from a dealbreaker and fits well within real-world expectations.Overall, the JBL Tune Flex feels like a thoughtfully designed, daily-driver set of earbuds that delivers where it counts. A strong contender for anyone who values comfort, control, and dependable sound in their everyday audio gear.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Quantum TWS True Wireless Noise Cancelling Gaming Earbuds,Jbl,"Update for an update: I contacted JBL support and they were very helpful. There was an update that showed up for the buds using the windows Quantum Engine application that did not show up from JBL Headphones on my phone. After updating, everything is working great. These things sound amazing!Update: May have spoke too soon. I'll check with JBL and see what's up. The 2.4ghz dongle worked great with my Oculus the first time I used it. The next day, I could only get audio in the left ear. Tried with my cell through the dongle, same issue. Factory reset on headphones didn't change it. Seems like the dongle is probably faulty and could have passed inspection.Original:I just received these earbuds today, your mileage may very, but I'm almost certain mine were completely new, never opened. There is literally no signs that the package has ever been opened. Down to the tape on the box that if you don't cut, will tear the box.If you do get a pair that even gives you the idea that you may not find our issues until after the return window, just return them and get another renewed pair... The savings here is amazing if you end up with a good pair of buds. And these are some of the best buds I've owned to date, hands down.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS True Wireless Noise Cancelling Gaming Earbuds,Jbl,"I've been using these for a few days now and I can honestly say that I really enjoy them. They definitely have their pros and cons as with any earbuds, but the cons stop these from reaching a 5 star rating for me.- Sound Quality: These earbuds sound great in all modes. The audio is crystal clear and you can clearly make out all sounds in a game or all instruments in music. They lean a bit towards being bass-heavy, but you can change that in the app/software that pairs with them. The active noise cancellation isn't as strong as some other options out there, but it's certainly passable.- Mic Quality: The mic is nothing special on these. Your friends/coworkers will be able to make out what you're saying, but the quality is nowhere near that of a headset or dedicated mic.- Battery Life: My biggest complaint is the battery life. On a full charge, they'll go for 3-5 hours. On the bright side, they charge relatively quickly in the case.- Connectivity: Bluetooth and the 2.4 GHz dongle work as you'd expect them to. Bluetooth is notoriously laggy on Windows, so with the dongle, games are actually playable without too much latency. There is still some, but it's miles better than trying to suffer through Bluetooth latency in a game.- Ease of use: The instructions are very clear and helpful, but the controls themselves aren't very obvious or intuitive. I find myself referring to the instruction manual for some of the functions that I use less frequently.I'd say these are absolutely worth it for the sale price of $75, but I can't see myself spending $150 on these. If you're looking for a lower latency 2.4 GHz connection, these are probably the best option out there currently.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Quantum TWS True Wireless Noise Cancelling Gaming Earbuds,Jbl,"I wanted a pair of wireless earbuds for gaming on a windows PC, requirements:- wireless earbuds rather than wireless headset, because I don't like pressure on my head for long hours- 2.4Ghz USB dongle rather than bluetooth. The last time I tried bluetooth for this purpose, I could never get the mic + audio to work correctly. This is something apple bluetooth airpods handle seamlessly- noise-cancelling would be niceI chose this pair because I hoped JBL would be better than some of the no-name chinese brands on Amazon. It generally fulfilled my requirements above, but had a bunch of issues that caused me to return them:- battery life! Claims 8 hours, I get <2 hours, which means it starts running out after 2 dota sessions. Really not usable- randomly when I put them on, one side doesn't work, and I need to put that side back in the case, and take it out again, really annoying- the touch controls are confusing as heck. When just putting them on, I'll often accidentally mute, or turn on ambient aware, or turn off noise cancelling. And I have no idea how to undo those via touch. I need to use their clunky app to figure out what settings are on, and set them straight.- earbuds are weirdly shaped such that they fall out on their own often.Overall, not a particularly well thought out product",2.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,The headphones fit perfectly while also having really good bass and sound quality. But out of the box the sound is a little funky but after 5 minutes of use it returns back to normal and while getting really good sound quality and also have slot of battery life.

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,"I had to write this review after losing my old iOS Pro Buds and needing a new pair. These JBL Vibe Buds were on sale for $30, and I expected just okay for the price. But they’re amazing value. JBL has built solid products for years, and these are no exception. For $30, the sound is fantastic, and they stay in my ears without any issue—the default fit out of the box was perfect, and they arrived fully charged.The QR code for the JBL app is a nice touch, offering easy access to different sound settings. I’m an AI music creator, and these buds deliver some of the best sound I’ve heard, even compared to more expensive options.If I ever lose them again, I’ll definitely be buying another pair. Highly recommended",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,"This product is exceptionally excellent,  ive had this exactly a year to this date, amd ive had this in the toughest weather condition possible, and still functioning as new, great quality sound, I mean this things is excellent.

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,"DO NOT BUY THESE.These have been a problem from the start. The first pair I got, the audio squeaked and dropped every few seconds. They would barely work with Apple products, and they'd work okay with Microsoft products. I submitted for an exchange or refund WITHIN DAYS OF RECEIVING THEM, and Amazon rejected both. I then contacted JBL and started the process over. I very clearly explained that I had done all of the trouble shooting possible. I was told to try the troubleshooting again, as there was no other option. I told them I wasn't going to waste my time, and that they needed to make it right. I got no reply.A week later I got an email requesting a review of my service, HILARIOUS. I let them know I received a defective product and was ignored by both Amazon and JBL. I told them you're welcome for the free money.I immediately got a reply apologizing and information to return the defective products, as well as a tracking number for the replacement pair.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues, although not as severely. I decided to keep them because wasn't interesting in spending more time begging to get what I'm owed. Aside from the audio issues, the casing on these have begun to chip off. These headphones sit on my desk all day. They do not get jostled inside of a bag or moved around whatsoever.I've had these second pair almost a year, and now they work even less then the original pair did. I'm going to go to the gas station and buy a $5 pair, drive over them with my car a few times, and they'll still sound better and be more durable than these earbuds ever did.JBL, I never wanted to talk to you again, but you're about to hear from me.

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,"For the price these are good. However, after a year of use, I noticed noticed bluetooth audio cutting out periodically which is frustrating and ruins music listening.

JBL Vibe Buds,Jbl,"For the price, these are great. I like to keep a pair of headphones by my bed to listen to audiobooks or music in bed. I had to replace an old pair of airpods because they wouldn’t hold a charge longer than 30 minutes. My primary focus was battery life. I fall asleep with these JBLs in and in the morning they still have at least half battery after sitting out of the case all night long. Second want for ear buds was something better at noise canceling than airpods (husband snores). These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don’t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it. Only complaint, and this is totally my fault, is that the rubber tips are slightly too large for my ears and they fall out a lot or make my ears sore. But they came with either replacement rubber tips or different sizes in the box when i got them and i threw them away. Since then ive been having a hard time finding generic replacement tips that don’t disrupt the charging on these. But like i said that’s on me. Anyways TL:DR baby best the price, excellent battery life, above average noise cancelling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Live Pro 2,Jbl,"Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Live Pro 2,Jbl,"These are my favorite JBL earphones I’ve had! They’re even better when you use the JBL app to customize your hearing experience. The noise cancellation feature is 10/10 & I love the wireless charging capability. The charging case is compact & lightweight. They’re better than Apple Beats & more affordable. Although I wish the pink ones were overnight-able, the black ones I purchased are still aesthetically pleasing.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Live Pro 2,Jbl,"I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds 2,Jbl,"What the heck kind of title is that you might ask???I have latest Apple Air Pods Pro... and it hard to compare yet I cheerfully have both.I constantly fret about losing my Apple buds with the charge down so I cant find them.It takes all the fun out of it for me.  ALSO the Apple don't have the base that I really like.I didn't want to get the JBL cheapest nor did I want to get the several hundred dollar version either.I have to compromise.. so .. HOPEFULLY this is helpful to someone on the fence like I was.1)JBL never feel secure in my ear and in trying to get them secure I inadvertently reset  or constantly cycle them.However.. Once in my ear.. and seated.. they are nice.. stay put and don't have that look I detest about myAplle ones.. I got the BLACK JBL TUNE BUDS 2 and they sort of dont stand out.  I hate the look that my earsalways have a ""Runny Nose"" look.. the dangling white thing hanging down.. I really appreciate JBL black.2)I have a very hard time figuring out how much charge is in my  JBL Tune Buds.  I only have battery clues thatare in the 3 white lights on the front of the case.  Fine... but I am never sure what charge is where and if buds are charged totally etc.  HOWEVER.. the JBL last through the night for me.  Apple seldom makes it ever so I have to use only one Apple bud at a time.  I really like the immersion of 2 buds to help sleep.  AND>>>  the JBL seem to last, for me, about twice as long as the Apple ones.  Still..  I never know what condition my c ondition is in HOWEVER.. if I get in a pinch.. I can drop back to 1 bud and go on forever with the JBL.3)The range .. for me.. is less for the JBL than the Apple  HOWEVER.. the JBL really are worth the slight drop in distance due to the lovely lovely BASS.. I love Bass.  That would make it hard for me to ditch or ghost the JBL.  I have 4 sets of buds.. A couple free sent for evaluation... however none stand up the quality of Apple Or JBL.  My evaluation free ones were in the $100 range so  I feel the comparison is valid.In conclusion... If you don't want that apple signature drippy white thing hanging down from your ear and you like a GOOOOD Bass thump and a REASONABLY fair price ... I think this is the one f or  you.  The lack of a good battery is still an issue but nor a deal breaker.  It is made up for by insanely fast charge and long battery life....Truly hope this helps a fence straddler..

JBL Endurance Peak 3,Jbl,"These are great! Good base and sound quality, you can choose presets or adjust the sound settings directly in the app. The microphone is pretty strong too, I drive big trucks for work and it's really noisy in the cab, other headphones I've used struggle to hear what I'm saying when using voice prompts for siri or Gemini but not one issue yet (when prompting with the earbuds). I've used them in the shower, at the gym, even in the sauna and they still work really good. In the app you can set the touch buttons to do nothing so you're not interrupting music or anything. Pretty good battery life, comfortable for long term wear, has a really good ambient mode to be able to hear what's going on around you, worth the money id say.***In the shower before I figured out the touch button thing I put the ear buds down while I washed my hair, water got into the ear bud holes, they still worked but the right one sounded a tad bit weird, put em in rice for 24hrs just case and no problems",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Peak 3,Jbl,"I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani  T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of  earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani  T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Peak 3,Jbl,Really good earbuds. Volume max is a little lower than I would prefer. Bass is good enough. They do not fall out.No fuether updates on this review as they were sadly stolen 3 months after purchase. My short time with them was good though! A bitter ending to a good story.Don't let them out of your sight :),4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Peak 3,Jbl,"These are amazing.  Sound quality is fantastic and the app integration is legit.  I do kinda wish they had volume controls but other than that they are perfect for running.  They are heavy and stay in place securely wrapped around the ear with minimal jostling while running.  Worth the money, however, I did get them for 40% off so like 60 bucks which is not a bad amount for such a solid piece of equipment.  The charging case is sturdy and solid.  Feels and looks sleek and modern.  Absolutely love them.  If you are tired of crappy headphones that wear out quickly, fall out, or are just cheap, check these out.  You won’t be disappointed, I’m not.  😊",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"Awesome earbuds! They have a great sound and they work great. The sound does leek a little out and the battery is not quite as advertised. They last closer to 3-4 hours. The touch controls are easy to use. Overall, they are very comfortable and they fit good.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"Sound and features are very nice for the price and build quality. For me I have to use the larger included ear tips or else it just feels too loose and I like more of an in-ear fit. The Flex 2 with the large ear tips have the best fitment, again “for me”. Which is surprising to me because I was the most skeptical about these. The Buds 2 had terrible fitment, and the Beam 2’s sealed fine on my right ear, but it would fall out sometimes on my left ear. Beam 2 also had a lot of problems when trying to use them for calls. To really get the best out of these you definitely need to use the JBL app. Try messing around with the EQ. I put up a picture of what someone else did and made my own. I know it looks weird, but it really works well. So far I’m happy with these. I will update if any issues arise.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"It comes with 4 different sizes of ear tips, so one of them will always fit. It's one of the only earbuds to have open ear and silicone tips available, which is a big plus. The sound quality is perfect and has great bass, and the case is surprisingly small.The only downside is that the plastic feels somewhat cheap, but it's not that big of a deal. It looks amazing with a silicone case as well",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"Sound quality is great, design is great, connectivity was a breeze.

JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"I had the TOZO NC9 and thought they were okay, always left me wanting a little bit better sound. I have several JBL speakers and they sound fantastic. So when I saw these on sale I had to try them. The sound is fantastic and the bass is so full and balanced. Noise cancelling is not bad at this price point, ambient aware works well and allows you to hear around you while still listening to your music. The Talk through mode is great, just double tap the left bud and it's like they aren't even in your ears. I'm very happy with the performance. Battery life is solid with the charging case. Case is compact with a rounded shape, so easy carry in your pocket. No wireless charging but not a deal breaker for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"I waited a couple months to give my honest, accurate and sad review.I had the JBL Tune Flex 1 for months and was amazing. I gave it to my younger brother and got the JBL Tune 2, hoping to have the same experience. The product do have interesting updates, like the noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk-through options. Although I couldn’t feel any difference between the first two, the talk-through option just lowers the volume and keep playing it. However, there are expressive downgrades compared to the first one:1) connection. If you get far away, it disconnects easily. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting to be 30 meters away. However, the same distance I was perfectly able to use it on the first one, now, it completely disconnects.  ALSO IT UNSYNC RANDOMLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PHONE IN FRONT OF YOU. It had happened several times while I am writing this review. Something that was rare, now it happens DAILY2) battery. Although the battery is still very decent, nothing compared to the first one. That I had for almost a year and charged every 3 weeks. This one, I have to charge once a week. The earbuds have a good battery, but the case that charges it doesn’t have as good as the first one.3) connection WHILE CLOSE. I am not sure how the connection is done, but if my phone is in my pocket upside down, the connection gets so unstable that every earbud loses its sync, and every single one starts playing in a different frequency. It’s crazy this happens!!I am very unsatisfied with this product and have been facing these issues since day 1. But waited to see if was going to keep like that or not. I would suggest to get the previous version or another brand earbuds (which I can’t recommend any bc I always preferred JBL due to its battery life)",1.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Tune Flex 2,Jbl,"The buds do not stay in my ears at all. If I am walking or eating, they fall out every other minute, and even standing perfectly still, they eventually fall out. I read the instructions in the box and searched for additional advice online with no success. I had to buy silicone attachments to make them stay in, but they are uncomfortable and annoying to put on every time I want to use the earbuds. The sound is good and I have always liked JBL earbuds in the past, but the ergonomic design of these is awful.",2.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race 2,Jbl,"Quite happy with these. After my beloved Pixel Buds started failing I had a hard time finding something that was a) as secure and comfortable in-ear as the Buds and 2) would allow me to hear ambient sounds like the Buds. These fit the bill just right.They have a little winglet on the earpiece like the Buds, and the same twist-to-lock design. They are quite secure in your ear without being uncomfortable. I thought the size would be an issue, bouncing around or something, but I barely notice them. The size IS an issue when cycling though, as the wind noise they generate is distracting on downhill bits.The battery life is remarkable. After a 50 minute ride I still had 97% battery. Nuts. I bet these would last a full workday.Sound quality is quite good. Vocals are clear and crisp, deep bass hits nicely, though it might be lacking a bit at mids and mid-bass. I'm quite pleased. These would be excellent if you do a lot of podcasts.I didn't want ANC because, again, I want to be aware of my surroundings when I work out, but the Ambient Awareness mode in these does it's advertised job nicely. Full ANC isn't going to be on the level of a Bose Quietcomfort, but it's pretty adequate. Time will tell if these do the job on an airplane. For working out though, I don't WANT a Quietcomfort--I need to have some spacial awareness, and these do that job well.I rate these 9/10 for the job they're designed for (workouts). For the $49 I paid for them, that's remarkable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race 2,Jbl,"Fantastic purchase! Sound quality is as good or better than my AirPod Pros, but these are more customizable with regard to the sound output (Bass, Rock, Club, vocal, Jazz, etc) and other settings. They were very easy to set up and connect to my IPhone.  They are comfortable to wear and don’t fall out easily. I’ll be using these solely for my hikes since the battery life along with the additional battery life in the case makes it a no-brainer! Case is not as small as the apple version, but feels like quality material.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race 2,Jbl,"So far, so good! I’ve been holding onto my JBL x Under Armor earbuds for YEARS (absolute favorite ever, hands down. Devastated they don’t make them anymore) and have been dreading having to find a decent replacement. So far, these have almost exactly the same sound quality, so I’m very impressed! No connectivity issues at all. I’ve always struggled to find ear buds that fit my ear shape, but these fit perfectly. I really hope I’m able to get the same length of use out of these as my other ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race 2,Jbl,"I'd rate these 3.5 if that were an option.  I switched to these after years of using similar priced and designed (as far as I can tell) Sony earbuds.The noise cancelling seems a little less pronounced than on similar Sony earbuds I have used (may not be a bad thing) and does not deal with wind noise as well (not a good thing), but overall works pretty well for dampening non-wind background noise.  The overall sound quality is adequate for my main use-cases - listening to podcasts and books and doing phone calls and video conferences. If I were more focused on listening to music, I'd want something better and I think the Sony ones were a bit better.The headphones often disconnect from Bluetooth when I'm walking around; sometimes they reconnect within about 3-7 seconds; other times I need to do this manually.  That is frustrating but quickly solved. I have not had the problem with the JBL headphones that repeatedly occurred with several sets of Sony earbuds I had, where the left earbud would refuse for hours, days or ""forever' to connect to Bluetooth. Repeatedly facing that issue with several iterations of Sony earbuds (which I otherwise liked and think were better than these JBL earbuds) is what caused me to give up on Sony and give JBL a try.The headphones stay in my ears during exercise and through sweating and bouncing around.  So far, I'm happy with the battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race 2,Jbl,"Updating my review: I have now used these on an airplane and they were incredible. The noise cancellation was so effective I could keep my volume lower and my ears feel much better. Still love them.Original review: I pre-ordered these to replace my aging JLB earbuds and I have been so pleased with them. The noise cancelling is like nothing I've ever experienced. I walk in the gym, it's loud in there (big chain gym). Once I turn on the noise cancellation (I use the functional training setting) WHOOSH, all of a sudden, all I can hear is my music. It's incredible. And these things can hold a charge like nothing else. They are very sweat proof. The sound quality is amazing, my music sounds so much better on these than my old earbuds. Getting a fit was easy and they stay in place all workout long, whether I'm lifting, on the elliptical or even doing aerobics. I love the customizable controls for taps. Everything about these is customizable! And they are also ready out of the box. Truly a great investment. With the noise cancelling I can keep the volume lower and it makes my ears feel much better. I do recommend if it's your first time with active noise cancelling (ANC), read up on what it does first. There's a good NYT article on it. All I can hear in the gym with ANC on full is clanking from weights, which is high frequency sound. The low frequency roar of treadmills and the vacuum them are always running is gone once I turn ANC on. Highly recommend, absolutely love them and a great value for the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Vibe Beam,Jbl,"Sound proof af and barely ever need charging. I got these for my husband about a year ago and he uses them every single day for his job events. They never die on him! He said he only charges them about once a week and uses them for about 3-4 hours a day. He let me use them during the first month our newborn came home and they saved my life since our baby had colic. They are also very compact so they fit inside of his pocket perfectly, even with a case. The bass quality is superb for such little buds too.

JBL Vibe Beam,Jbl,"The Good:1. I paid $24 for these back in November of '24 as part of a Black Friday special and am quite happy with the purchase.2. They sound really, really good -- but only when I apply pressure to them, push them into my ears and hold them.3. I dropped one into a sink full of water for two or three seconds (totally submerged). I expected it to die but it still played! (Another time sweat ran down into my ear and conked it out for the evening.)4. The free JBL Headphones app has an equalizer, as well as some other features, which will allow you to make some adjustments to the sound ( I tried it but didn't notice a big difference and ended up uninstalling it to free up memory).5. Some people claim you can mold your own earbud tips and improve the fit and sound quality.The Bad:1. They don't fit snuggly. I tried the different sized rubber ear tips that came with it and none of them are quite right.2. The sound is very thin. This is 100% a fit issue. Shove them in and hold them and they sound really good.3. When the batteries get low you get an audible ""battery is low"" message. Fine but as the battery gets lower, the message eventually stats coming every twenty seconds or so (maybe faster). It's quite annoying.4. Getting them in and out of the case is somewhat of a PITA due to some design issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Vibe Beam,Jbl,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Endurance Race TWS,Jbl,"These are great because they stay in my ears almost perfectly compared to other major brands and my earlier non-locking JBLs. I wanted waterproof so I could listen to my books or music in the shower as I got ready in the morning, but I have to remember to change the tapping settings (pause, skip, volume, Siri, etc) to off before or else EVERY water drop will cause it to do something. ANYTHING that brushes the side of the device while wearing it causes it to do something, usually pausing it for me, but if it brushes back AND forth, it may skip ahead. It’s just annoying. Whatever. Still better than most because I have the OPTION of using in water. And it still works after without sounding wonky (if your ears are dry; putting them INTO wet ears make them slippery and sound weird out of shower).I am buying another set because I lost one of them rushing upstairs to wake up my kids for a tornado siren (false alarm). Since they are fairly cheap, I don’t even mind just replacing it.  The lost feature is pretty worthless-if it’s dead (or out of range?), it will tell you it can’t be found, not last known location or last time used…Nothing helpful. I had to wait until after work to look, and it must have been drained by then.It charges quick; but it’s annoying when it keeps beeping (or speaking: battery low) to remind me. I wish I could limit reminders so it would just stop playing after a warning. I like falling asleep to a book and the beep or voice prompt abruptly wakes me up/stops that process unnecessarily.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race TWS,Jbl,"Since purchasing the JBL headphones I’ve completely enjoyed using them. There functionality and ease of use is top notch. The wireless headphones stay charged for a very long duration. There are a little pricey but worth the money. They fit well in my ears. However, after a few hours, the extra rubber piece that gives it a better hold to the ear, starts to cause pain. So I’m not able to wear and use them for a long time period. I’ve been impressed with the design until recently. A piece that covers the plastic ear tip has come out. Which has made it collect dust down inside the earbud. They are very hard to clean once the ear rubber size is taken off, especially if there is dust or a little bit of ear wax.I would still recommend and buy again. Hoping the construction and pieces are more durable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Endurance Race TWS,Jbl,"I purchased these on three different occasions. The first pair I purchased in December, 2023 were great!! I workout quite consistently and heavily and sweat a lot. The first pair continued to deliver great sound and remain in my ear even during the most intense of workout sessions.Sadly, I lost my first pair two months after buying them (my fault) and purchased a second pair without hesitation. The second pair held up well until after a while they didn't. After a couple of years, one ear went bad until both earbuds eventually didn't produce any sound regardless of how charged they were. No big deal. I chalked it up as it being time to replace them.In May, 2025, I purchased a brand new third set. I don't know what happened in two years since the purchase of the first/second sets or if this set was just malfunctioned, but these buds could not handle my workouts. Sweat would cause one earbud (mainly the right one) to clog and not produce any sound and the sound quality of the other earbud was horrible. The volume would go very low (even with the volume turned all the way up) and the sound was garbled. UGGGHHHH!!! So disappointing!!! I dealt with them like this for three months holding out hope that these were just rare instances that would eventually correct over time. No such luck! Also the buds would loosen from my ears and slowly slide out of position (sometimes falling out). To remedy this I would wear bandanas to help hold them in place. SO ANNOYING!!I just don't want to deal with this anymore, so into the drawer of used and dead electronic items it goes along with the old cell phones, non-working chargers, and the second pair of lame JBL Race earbuds. I'm really bummed, but it's time to move on to better!  One star.",1.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Endurance Race TWS,Jbl,"These earbuds are decent for the price, I did like the sound quality and how they fit on my ears, but after having them for slightly over a year they become completely unusable. The touch controls were the first to start having problems, then the headphones wouldn’t turn off after putting them back in the case causing the batteries to drain from the earbuds and case, on top of that the charging system isn’t very effective and for me showed a lot of problems, sometimes the charging light would not come on so I couldn’t tell if they were charging in the first place, then the last time I tried plugging them in it completely shorted out the block they were plugged into. These are a good buy if you aren’t planning on using them daily or for long term, this is quite disappointing because all other jbl products I have still work after 5+ years of use, I think this model specifically is just kind of prone to breaking after about a year.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tour Pro 3,Jbl,"Day n+1 update:Warning: once you lost the AUX to USB-C cable like me, it's almost no way to buy this cable.

Kind of slight ""heee"" sound, kind of annoying.Day 3 Update: I still like to turn on LDAC.Its ANC is indeed a bit strange at times. For example, when I was riding my scooter or walking near a construction area, I noticed some kind of high-frequency knocking sounds.Also, when I wear a raincoat or put up the hood of my hoodie, it keeps accidentally touching the earbuds—almost like it’s happening a thousand times!Day 2 Update:After: 1. Update firmware of earbuds and the case. 2. Use AAC (instead of LDAC) decoding. 3. Disable ""Smart Talk"". Now the battery of earbuds seems to last for 8 hours.What others I didn't expect:Its earbud tips are not as comfortable as those on the Jabra Active 7. When removing them from your ears, there is a sensation of suction, followed by a slight “pop” sound feeling to the ear. Sometimes, this causes the earbud to end up in the wrong orientation, and you have to adjust it by hand to put it back in the correct position.The sound isn't best but better than I expected. I think it's good enough and worth the price together with its other features. 3.5mm connector to Auracast to earbuds is a very important use case to me (and it works).Changing the picture of the case display is interesting after I found a personal and good picture.--- Day 1 review ---I bought these earbuds mainly for the advertised long battery life. However, on the first day of use, with a full 100% charge, they only lasted about 4 hours — far from the claimed 8 hours and not consistent with what other reviews suggested.Here’s what I experienced:1. The first time I took them out of the charging case, the battery dropped from 100% to 90% in less than ten minutes — before I even used them.2. When I connected them to my phone (an Android), I noticed they had already been paired with a device named ""iPhone,"" which raises concern that they might be refurbished.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tour Pro 3,Jbl,"I don't necessarily write reviews. But as someone that has been on the search for the best earbuds. I have owned the bose QC ultras old and new version. Every single pair of apple airpods. And galaxy buds. I also have sonys over ear wxm4s and 5s.But I must say this is the one device that has truly left me feeling like my money was well spent. I have heard sounds in my songs I didn't even know were there. Not to mention I have had no connection issues whatsoever, which coming from bose you know although they sound great (when they work) the connection is absolute DOG water. Wasting over $1000+ on Bose and sony headphones has pushed me to write this review. If you are looking for something worth while and that sounds so absolutely amazing with great noise cancellation these are the pair.I always went back to my airpod pros due to their ease of access, although that's their main selling point the sound is lacking and could use work. These JBLS take the crown for me. Great work JBL will be buying more products from here on out!",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tour Pro 3,Jbl,"Absolutely the best earbuds I have ever owned. Soundwise I enjoy them more than either the Sony or Bose ultra 2 & the liberty 4 pro. Exactly what I've been looking for. The ANC is not AS good as the other 3, but the sound and features more than make up for that. Anc isn't bad, but you do get a little background noise from TV in the room. Actual people and my dogs are not noticeable though. But the SOUND!  Best I've heard",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tour Pro 3,Jbl,"These earbuds have very good audio in general, with typical JBL somewhat bass-heavy sound. However, the equalizer function's customizability easily compensates for the coloration. Other features include Ambient Noise Cancelling, spatial audio with optional head tracking, a smart charging case with touchscreen controls for nearly all features, a companion mobile device app with controls for all features, the case can be used as a transmitter to get the sound to the earbuds from non-Bluetooth devices with audio out via USB (A or C) or ⅛ inch (3.5 mm) headphone jack, or anything that can be adapted to one of those. Buds are capable of receiving Auracast audio. You can also listen to your tracks in high-resolution LDAC audio at 24 bits & 96 kHz. The only major features that I've seen elsewhere, that the Tour Pro 3 lack is a case that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker or a power bank. But honestly, does anyone really want to carry that extra weight around with the earbuds all the time? I already have a power bank and several Bluetooth speakers. I only carry them around when I reasonably expect to want or need them.However, I found the experience of using the buds for the first time less than satisfying. The main reason for replacing my previous earbuds was declining battery life. But though they were inexpensive (brand 233621, model Zen), they had what I now realize to be excellent broad-spectrum ANC. The Tour Pro 3, in contrast, even at their maximum ANC setting, allow quite a lot of high-frequency noise through that the Zen cancel. This was quite noticeable and annoying while vacuuming the house. I expect better from a flagship product of a well-known brand such as Harman/JBL. If I hadn't gotten them at the Cyber Monday discount with the help of a gift card that covered half the cost I would definitely be returning them and getting something else.I have read elsewhere that the Tour Pro 3's 360 Spatial Audio is also lackluster, but having nothing to compare it to, I can't say much about it. Head tracking seems to work as expected when enabled, moving sounds from center to left or right as I  move my head, but the spatial effect is minimal for me. I'm one of those for whom headphones and earbuds nearly exclusively produce sound that seems to come from inside my head on a line between my ears. Without head tracking, the Tour Pro 3's spatial audio adds fullness and extension so sounds hard-panned left and right (or nearly so) seem to come from outside my head, and those from nearer the center of the stereo image seem to be slightly forward and less sharply defined, but still inside my head. Using headphones or earbuds, I've never heard any effect that made the sounds seem to emanate realistically from somewhere in front of me. It's likely that I never will, just because of how my ears and brain are.Verdict: I'll keep them, but if I had known in advance how weak the Tour Pro 3's ANC was, I would have chosen another brand & model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS AIR,Jbl,"First Thing: UPDATE these ear buds. You need to do it TWICE! Get the JBL app for your phone and software update the buds, then get the JBL Quantum Engine App for PC (or Mac) and do the firmware update. Before the updates I could only get one bud/channel to work with Android using the dongle, and after the updates both buds work. So far I have tested the USB-C Dongle with PC, Steam Deck, iPad, and Android - it works well with all devices listed providing low latency, and high(er) fidelity, sound. I tested multiple games on Steam Deck, including Hi-Fi Rush (a rhythm game), and had no latency issues. The Dongle is true plug and play (no setup needed) on every device except PC. Plugging in the USB-C Dongle prompted a download of Quantum Engine, and inside the QE app you can set EQ and tweak the Surround Sound settings. I tested the buds in Battlefield V on PC and the surround sound worked well. Adjusting the EQ in the QE app on PC is easy and necessary in order to get the most pleasing sound. The only device I’m using Bluetooth with is my Android phone and the sound is fine - use the JBL app to adjust the EQ. The Android App offers a FULL EQ, not the typical/lame EQ for dummies a lot of ear bud devices ship with.I’ve only had the JBL Quantum TWS Airs (that name lol) for a short time, so I can’t offer a comprehensive review yet. I will say they are very light and fit well in my ears. There is no wing, or stabilizer, so these might not be great for active on-the-go situations. The stock EQ needed a tweak for my ears, and the Apps make that easy. The sound quality via the USB-C Dongle is a noticeable upgrade in terms of latency and fidelity. These are better for music than I anticipated, and from reviews I read this is one of the big differences from the more expensive, and older version, of this line of Quantum TWS buds. Battery life is much shorter using the Dongle, and that makes sense as the low latency signal is more power hungry than Bluetooth. I spent some time looking for low latency wireless ear buds and this is one the most affordable options out there ($40 on sale). Hopefully in time more companies will offer similar low latency earbuds, or maybe Bluetooth will get good enough to make a product like this irrelevant.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS AIR,Jbl,"Got these for $50 new in box marked as ""used"". The sound quality is great. I use them for the gym and for gaming. Im very competitive so im sensitive to latency and these have none that i can notice. They do get uncomfortable after long gaming sessions but most earbuds do that in my ears. Battery life could be better. They last around 4-5 hours with ANC enabled, with it off I'm not sure but definitely a lot longer than 5 hrs. They also look nice, not gamery or bulky.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS AIR,Jbl,"They have an excellent sound quality, the ANC works pretty well and it's also adaptative, I'm not a fan of a talk-through function I think it's best to just pause your music.The headphones are pretty comfortable and fit perfectly for my ear, the battery life is very good too. The case is a little too big for carrying it on a pocket but still can fit. It charges pretty fast too and I appreciate that.The voice assistant is very useful, it can read and answer message and read u all your notifications. Also control smart home devices which I use a lot.Only problem with it is that the dongle doesn't work very well with other smartphones or tablets, I read that the Pc firmware update can fix that but my Pc doesn't have a usb-c port and I haven't been able to buy an adapter (and it can't connect to the pc app by Bluetooth for some reason).Definitely a good purchase still just for it's in-app customization, voice assistant features and sound quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS AIR,Jbl,"So I bought these earbuds on discount for $75 on Black Friday, and I want to share some thoughts I have about this thing.1. It's not exactly perfectly low latency. I play rhythm games a lot, and I do notice a slight amount of latency even with the ""low latency"" dongle mode. I've tried disabling any audio processing on Windows, but it's still the same. The latency is fairly low given that it's wireless. You'll be hard pressed to notice for other games like Valorant, but there's just a touch of latency which prevents me from using it for rhythm games in particular.2. Audio is pretty good. Very bass heavy as you'd expect, but there is an EQ so you can change it around. Once you balance it out with the EQ I think the audio quality is quite exceptional for these buds.3. Battery life is mid. When you use it in low-latency mode the battery dies in around 3-4 hours without ANC or processing. Probably take off an hour if you had it on. The bluetooth mode lasts for much longer, I'd peg it around 6 hours (although I've never fully drained it in bluetooth yet).4. Charging is fairly fast for both the case and the earbuds.5. There are some strange audio artifacts (glitching and occasionally choppy audio) with the dongle. This happens very occasionally, and I've tried disabling interference like from Wi-Fi and other 2.4Ghz accessories but it still occurs.6. I think the touch controls are hard to learn. The one for switching modes is fairly straightforward, but pairing, switching, and learning play/pause is not intuitive.7. Noise cancellation is quite weak compared to many other earbuds on the market, similar with the ""transparency mode"" on these things. Talk-thru actually is OK, but sounds artificial and you can definitely tell the noise from outside is piped in.8. They sit comfortably in the ears and don't feel like they're gonna fall out. However, at least for me, they get uncomfortable over like 1 hour of wearing.Overall, given the discounted $75 price I think they're a great pair of buds, better than other $99 Bluetooth buds on the market. At the original $150, there are much better options (without low latency dongle).And gamers beware, if you are planning to use these for latency critical audio tasks, these are NOT for you. Stick to wired or look for something else. These get quite close but I still notice a tad bit of audio latency.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"Very comfortable, decent noise cancelling, both ear bud & case batteries last better than my last pair of Sony earbuds. I do not have excellent ears, age, heredity, and industrial noise have seen to that, so the highs are probably wasted on me, but I have enjoyed the excellent image these buds create; I have a favorite recording of Handel's ""Messiah"", and it's easy to ""see"" where each soloist and group of singers, along with the parts of the orchestra are arranged, like you would at a live performance. As one group sings, then another one comes in you can hear the source coming from another area. The earbuds do work themselves out from time to time, but give warning & are easy to reposition. My last pair was the best Sony model, which I lost one of. I didn't want to drop another $250 , so I bought these. Now I never will. Tremendous value, with no indication of being cheap. One tiny issue: when dropped from waist high or higher onto a hard surface , the case invariably pops open and ejects both earbuds several feet. My fault, of course, but just saying. 10 month update: quality continues; sound is excellent & both earbud and holder batteries continue to last and last.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"These earbuds sound awesome! The features are great! They are a bit bulky and it took me awhile to get them to fit and I was actually wearing them wrong to begin with, you’re supposed to put them in your ear and then turn them to the left to screw them into your ears and after I did that they fit so much better. The touch controls work great and I like how you can adjust the controls for your own liking on the app. I use these at work and I can hear everything going on around me as well as what I’m listening to with the ambient aware which is amazing to me. Definitely a lot of features for the money and the battery actually last about 10 hours! I have these connected to my iPhone 17 and they connect fast every time and Siri works just fine as well. The only con is that they are a bit bulky and I do have to adjust them at times but not a big deal to me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"I bought these earbuds and simply use them everyday. I find the battery durability satisfactory, as well as the charging time.

For me, the sound is pretty good and also the noise cancelling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"I ordered these to replace a set of cheaper buds that I'd used for several years. Overall I'm satisfied but not thrilled.As noted in other reviews, these are pretty difficult to put back into the case. You have to orient them just right and I find myself fumbling with them alot to get them in.Sound quality is acceptable, although they sound a little 'tinny' to me. The EQ gives some help, but I still have some work to get them to warm up. Maybe they'll be better after breaking in for a while.My biggest complaint is probably the noise reduction. It works a little, but I can still hear alot of what's going on around me. I was hoping for it to be more effective.I will probably keep them, but if I had more flexibility I'd probably shop around a bit more. I expected more for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"Very comfortable, I use the small tips and so far they haven’t tried to fall out when I shake my head around.

JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"Pros:Reputation Brand NameGood sound with JBL Headphone appPlenty of bass with JBL Headphone appCONS:FitBluetooth disconnectsI purchased these after mt galaxy bud 2 died, due to one bud falling out into my pool last year then finally died about a month ago.My primary use for ear buds is listening to music while doing yard work (mowing, weed eating, edging) and during pool maintenance (brushing the walls and vacuuming).When I first received these, I downloaded the app and they paired nicely with no issues. Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend? Probably notDo i think these were worth what I paid for them? No, with the fit issue, these should cost closer to $19.99",3.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Live PRO+ TWS True Wireless in-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones,Jbl,"Amazing pair of earphones. The noise canceling is pretty good, but the battery life is the most impressive.

JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"A lot of pros with one con.I didn’t think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, “I haven’t used my Airpods since buying these!” so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc.  I can’t actually remember all of the problems at this point.  BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it’s Black Friday and I bite on these because they’re on sale.  I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars.  Turns out average reviews aren’t everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they’re comfortable, and the sound is amazing.  As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble.  These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ’d. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync’ing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is  very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It’s not a huge deal - it’s easy to pop them in for a split second if they’ve timed out or something.  But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case.  I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL’s part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I’m doing my part to raise it.  In everyday life it’s not that big of a deal unless you’re the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"I bought these on the Black Friday sale and man, I'm so glad I did.  I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment.  I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out.  Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings!  This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out.  Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear.  Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes.  You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good.  The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time.  I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music.  These are that clear.  They also don't kill my ears!  I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically.  With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app.  Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13.  Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution.  I'd definitely buy these again!",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,Great product! The quality of the sound Is pristine and clear and has nice bass to it.The problem: it keeps coming off my ear so I find myself usually adjusting it so the won’t fall. It does happens more with the left but both ears do it. Thats the only problem honestly. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it syncs well.Ear size: I also change a bigger ear tip so they fit more snug but still after a while they start coming off even though when I rotate it so stays put But that’s probably also because I’m working out when that Happens.Battery last a long time!,4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Tune Buds,Jbl,"Good sounding. Noise canceling is great for the price.  Talk through/passive is very functional. Case and buds put through washer. Then dried at 120*F for 36 hours. No sign of life at all from anything. Plugged in case to charge and everything woke up and works fine now! My ear canals are very small and had to use aftermarket smaller tips but fit well now. If you have to use the small or extra small tips usually just order black so they match aftermarket color ones if you care.Only issue I have is you cant have all the ambient controls, media controls, and volume control its two of the three.",5.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Vibe 100 TWS True Wireless In-Ear Headphones w/Charging Case,Jbl,So first off I bought 2 sets of these I wanna say 2 years ago ish.. maybe a little less I can't remember. One for me one for my husband which later another became mine lol..So i work at gfs a huge warehouse. First tome I dropped one of the ear buds thru the grates I'm the floor.. not just onto the floor 5 storys.. I managed to see where it landed and it's a crane zone so I had to get my boss to get it.. he found it still worked.. a few weeks go buy I fumbled the whole case ear phones and all in the freezer where I work all the time.. I loose one found the other. A week goes buy and one of my friends in janitorial was cleaning mind you another 3 storys.. finds it! I charge it up it still works! Another time samet headphones bc it's got a different color rubber on it bc I lost the one it came with.. I was doing some cleaning in another dept and had a mop bucket next to me full of kinda Nasty water.. not gonna lie. I feel the head phone slip out of my ear.. and I tried to catch it bit instead hand paddled it right into the mop bucket 😅 I kid you not.. it was in there for a good 10 seconds bc I had to roll up my sleeve to reach in.. I flicked it off dried it with a cloth real good left it in my bag so it could get the monster out before charging it.. and sure as shoot it still works.. but they have become a bit annoying now bc I do work in the freezer below 0 for like 12 hours 5 days a week.. nothing charges in that.. I still use both sets they usually die about 4 hours to 5 hours in and I swap to my husband's old pair lol. But I can't complain with these they have quite a story to tell. 😅 I do wish they were rated below 0 so they lasted longer but sometimes if they do die I just leave them in they make for great noise canceling with all the fans and belts going it gets loud and when I hear the fans running it makes me even colder so even dead they have there use.The bass is also great.Case could have a cover but they still hold on with Magnet.,5.0 out of 5 stars

The buds come with 3 tips that will most likely fit most people's ears, however none of the 3 fit my ears snug enough to stay in while running.  I was constantly fiddling with them on runs to keep them from falling out.

JBL LIVE PRO+ TWS True Wireless In-ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones,Jbl,"Amazing pair of earphones. The noise canceling is pretty good, but the battery life is the most impressive. I use it for 4-5 hours of zoom calls everyday, but don’t have to charge it for almost two weeks. Connects very quickly to both my iPhone and mac. Calls are pretty flawless.”Tap” controls are a bit annoying since I can reset or change them only on the app on my phone, whereas I use mostly on my work laptop.

JBL LIVE PRO+ TWS True Wireless In-ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones,Jbl,"For quality vs price, JBL's Live Pro+ TWS bluetooth earbuds are well worth the cost in my opinion. The sound is great (you can program your own EQ via the app among other options). The battery has a long life. The noise canceling works great. The only negative I've experienced is the noise canceling will occasionally stop working when tilting my head down. I don't know what is causing it at this time (it could be me). Luckily, it can be fixed by using the app to calibrate the fit of the earbuds; however, it can still be an annoyance. Regardless, I'm still loving the product. Recommended.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Tour PRO+ TWS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Jbl,"These started out at $200, I waited and waited and got them for $100. Worth the wait. These are high-end earbuds for sure. As high end as Bluetooth can be anyway. I believe they are now back up to $200.Initially, when I first used them, the sound seemed low for the sound level I'm accustomed to on other earbuds. But as my ears acclimated to them...or possibly the earbuds burned in...the sound became more involved and I can hear a wider soundstage than with other earbuds.Overall sound is clean, crisp and clear. The bass is strong if you have and can maintain a sufficiently tight seal in the ear. The stock eartips didn't provide a reliable seal so I installed the largest eartips I have from my Panasonic RZ-S500W earbuds. That did the trick. Reliable seal and they fit in the JBL charging case.The charging case is a little on the large side, but it's still okay. Excellent build quality. Battery life so far on the buds and case are great. But I rarely use earbuds longer than 3 hours so BL isn't much of a concern to me.For reference, I have or have had the earbuds listed below. I will say that I am favoring these JBL earbuds over all of them but my Master & Dynamic MW-07. But I grab these more often because the M&D earbuds don't last more than 2.5 hours battery life. And at about 1.5 hours they produce a warning sound that repeats every so often. Nevertheless, the M&D sound quality is among the best I've ever heard.[Ranked ONLY for sound quality from best to worst]Master & Dynamic MW-07Technics EAH-AZ70W (Best ANC and exceptional sound quality, but battery depletes while powered off)JBL Tour PRO+Technics EAH-AZ60Sony WF-1000XM4 (Bought for ""World leading ANC"".

JBL Tour PRO+ TWS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Jbl,"I have been very eager to try these, and after losing my beloved Samsung pros, I decided I had to buy! Comparatively on price, these match to many top name brand earbuds on the market, however they blow the competition out of the water! Other than a having a hard time finding a comfortable fitment for my smaller ears, as these buds are bigger than most, the pros of this product outweigh everything negative by miles!The sound quality is unparalleled for the price, with an insane immersive audio, that can be fully adjusted and controlled from the app!The easy to operate touch controls are not overly sensitive, preventing that annoying accidental command. Battery will last longer than my phone, and working in a factory setting, I keep them in for the noise canceling all day without recharge.Currently looking for a protector case, similar to my samsung pros waterproof case, as the charging case does seem a bit brittle like all others, but that doesn't mean anything!

JBL Tour PRO+ TWS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Jbl,"I bought these to connect to my computer for work from home.  They would not stay connected to a laptop...any laptop.  I tried several and the buds would just disconnect from them.  I called jbl who then said it is a computer problem because they would connect to my phone so I decided to try to use them with my phone because they were not cheap.  I know they are nowhere near the cost of the gold standard option but for my budget they are not cheap.  Here is the process to using them.  First, moisten the rubber pads by breathing on them.  Then jamb them into your ear until it feels as though you shoved a lit candle into your ear.  Turn on the noise canceling.  This part is essential to block out background noise then crank the sound all the way up.  This is not to jam out to rock,  this is just so that you can hear the audio book you are listening to.  Yeah, I'm that guy that listens to audio books for fun.  Now DO NOT MOVE.  Don't blink, don't look around ot they will jump out of your ears with even minor movement.  Try the different sized earpieces.  It will slightly adjust the heat level of the lit candle and will have no impact on how secure they are in your ears.  Turn off noise canceling and turn on ambient aware and you can hear mumbled conversations the neighbors the next block over are having.  Don't worry about privacy, nothing is clear enough to understand a word.  It is the same with someone conversing with you in the same room.  You get a great impression of Charlie brown listening to a class lecture, only amplified.  The last straw was today when I tried to spare my family of the latest book and only the left bud will connect.  It just so happens you have to have the right bud to do much of anything.  So for the bargain price of about $8 per use I have come to the end of the lifespan of these buds.  Not bad for what a jbl representative assure me is the quality that I should expect.  I will end this 9-month journey by biting the bullet and looking at some samsung buds or maybe a pair of Raycons.",1.0 out of 5 stars

JBL VIBE 100 TWS,Jbl,All in all I'm not disappointed in purchasing these and I'm not going to tell you to not buy them but just know you kind of get what you pay for The fitment though I know it's subjective at least in my case is not very comfortable especially in my left ear they feel rather sharp like they're cutting into my ears.The volume isn't very loud probably loud enough for most people but I like my music a little louder these are not audio file headphones but they are kind of fun to listen to they've got the bog standard Bluetooth headphones equalizer setup heavy base The mids are toned down quite a bit and enough treble. Bottom line they work fine for activities like mowing the lawn waiting for a bus to arrive or canceling out loud noise during demo work I've actually used them as earplugs a couple of times they're not waterproof.Dropping them more than not ends up with one of the headphones flying across the floor as there is no lid on the case I get it it's part of the design but it's a little annoying I find that the case will only charge them about 1 and 1/2 times before the case is dead which can be a little annoying as well I do like the type c charger port on the case but other than that they're pretty much the bog standard cheap earbuds we've all come to know.One final thing again this might just be my weird ears but they don't seem to stay in very well especially the left ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Quantum TWS,Jbl,"First Thing: UPDATE these ear buds. You need to do it TWICE! Get the JBL app for your phone and software update the buds, then get the JBL Quantum Engine App for PC (or Mac) and do the firmware update. Before the updates I could only get one bud/channel to work with Android using the dongle, and after the updates both buds work. So far I have tested the USB-C Dongle with PC, Steam Deck, iPad, and Android - it works well with all devices listed providing low latency, and high(er) fidelity, sound. I tested multiple games on Steam Deck, including Hi-Fi Rush (a rhythm game), and had no latency issues. The Dongle is true plug and play (no setup needed) on every device except PC. Plugging in the USB-C Dongle prompted a download of Quantum Engine, and inside the QE app you can set EQ and tweak the Surround Sound settings. I tested the buds in Battlefield V on PC and the surround sound worked well. Adjusting the EQ in the QE app on PC is easy and necessary in order to get the most pleasing sound. The only device I’m using Bluetooth with is my Android phone and the sound is fine - use the JBL app to adjust the EQ. The Android App offers a FULL EQ, not the typical/lame EQ for dummies a lot of ear bud devices ship with.I’ve only had the JBL Quantum TWS Airs (that name lol) for a short time, so I can’t offer a comprehensive review yet. I will say they are very light and fit well in my ears. There is no wing, or stabilizer, so these might not be great for active on-the-go situations. The stock EQ needed a tweak for my ears, and the Apps make that easy. The sound quality via the USB-C Dongle is a noticeable upgrade in terms of latency and fidelity. These are better for music than I anticipated, and from reviews I read this is one of the big differences from the more expensive, and older version, of this line of Quantum TWS buds. Battery life is much shorter using the Dongle, and that makes sense as the low latency signal is more power hungry than Bluetooth. I spent some time looking for low latency wireless ear buds and this is one the most affordable options out there ($40 on sale). Hopefully in time more companies will offer similar low latency earbuds, or maybe Bluetooth will get good enough to make a product like this irrelevant.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS,Jbl,"Got these for $50 new in box marked as ""used"". The sound quality is great. I use them for the gym and for gaming. Im very competitive so im sensitive to latency and these have none that i can notice. They do get uncomfortable after long gaming sessions but most earbuds do that in my ears. Battery life could be better. They last around 4-5 hours with ANC enabled, with it off I'm not sure but definitely a lot longer than 5 hrs. They also look nice, not gamery or bulky.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS,Jbl,"They have an excellent sound quality, the ANC works pretty well and it's also adaptative, I'm not a fan of a talk-through function I think it's best to just pause your music.The headphones are pretty comfortable and fit perfectly for my ear, the battery life is very good too. The case is a little too big for carrying it on a pocket but still can fit. It charges pretty fast too and I appreciate that.The voice assistant is very useful, it can read and answer message and read u all your notifications. Also control smart home devices which I use a lot.Only problem with it is that the dongle doesn't work very well with other smartphones or tablets, I read that the Pc firmware update can fix that but my Pc doesn't have a usb-c port and I haven't been able to buy an adapter (and it can't connect to the pc app by Bluetooth for some reason).Definitely a good purchase still just for it's in-app customization, voice assistant features and sound quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JBL Quantum TWS,Jbl,"So I bought these earbuds on discount for $75 on Black Friday, and I want to share some thoughts I have about this thing.1. It's not exactly perfectly low latency. I play rhythm games a lot, and I do notice a slight amount of latency even with the ""low latency"" dongle mode. I've tried disabling any audio processing on Windows, but it's still the same. The latency is fairly low given that it's wireless. You'll be hard pressed to notice for other games like Valorant, but there's just a touch of latency which prevents me from using it for rhythm games in particular.2. Audio is pretty good. Very bass heavy as you'd expect, but there is an EQ so you can change it around. Once you balance it out with the EQ I think the audio quality is quite exceptional for these buds.3. Battery life is mid. When you use it in low-latency mode the battery dies in around 3-4 hours without ANC or processing. Probably take off an hour if you had it on. The bluetooth mode lasts for much longer, I'd peg it around 6 hours (although I've never fully drained it in bluetooth yet).4. Charging is fairly fast for both the case and the earbuds.5. There are some strange audio artifacts (glitching and occasionally choppy audio) with the dongle. This happens very occasionally, and I've tried disabling interference like from Wi-Fi and other 2.4Ghz accessories but it still occurs.6. I think the touch controls are hard to learn. The one for switching modes is fairly straightforward, but pairing, switching, and learning play/pause is not intuitive.7. Noise cancellation is quite weak compared to many other earbuds on the market, similar with the ""transparency mode"" on these things. Talk-thru actually is OK, but sounds artificial and you can definitely tell the noise from outside is piped in.8. They sit comfortably in the ears and don't feel like they're gonna fall out. However, at least for me, they get uncomfortable over like 1 hour of wearing.Overall, given the discounted $75 price I think they're a great pair of buds, better than other $99 Bluetooth buds on the market. At the original $150, there are much better options (without low latency dongle).And gamers beware, if you are planning to use these for latency critical audio tasks, these are NOT for you. Stick to wired or look for something else. These get quite close but I still notice a tad bit of audio latency.",3.0 out of 5 stars

JBL Tune 130NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones,Jbl,"these earbuds are very dependable and after having had my previous earbuds (AirPods (the older kind)) start to break after a few months, these earbuds have been a godsend. They are way easier to fit into ears and they come with multiple different size plugs. They cost around the same and have way better, audio quality, they also are more user-friendly. The battery life is amazing way better than my phone probably could last a solid week before having to recharge the case and the battery isn’t even that diminished if I fall asleep and I’m listening for around 12 hours. I definitely recommend this product because the battery life is amazing. They connect super easily. They are super comfortable and the side buttons are a lot more understandable Than any earbuds I’ve used before. I feel there a lot more durable as well. I really enjoy that the case let me know how charged it is. I feel like they put a lot of work into designing these earbuds so that they Our genuinely good product, not just a product that they expect to phase out within the next five years. Amazing product if you’re on the fence, you should definitely go for it. I don’t even reviews often, but I was prompted to just because of how awesome these earbuds are.

JBL Tune 130NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones,Jbl,"I bought these to help filter out noise at the office generally for music listening. I will split the review into three section: Noise Cancelling, Sound Quality, and Other.Noise Cancelling:They will work for some people but not all. At the home office they work great, they filter out the frequency of noise produced by computer fans. However, I don't believe the noise cancelling is all that adaptive, rather it is just filtering a fixed number of frequencies. For example, the higher frequency noise from my air purifier is still noticeable, but dampened. This seems to be the case with all noise. I would expect their algorithm is doing something like filtering out the average frequencies in the average environment so overall you do indeed get a quieter listening experience.  ̶I̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶""̶A̶m̶b̶i̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶A̶w̶a̶r̶e̶""̶ ̶s̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶q̶u̶i̶e̶t̶e̶s̶t̶.̶  (UPDATE: Meant to say ANC (duh) slightly confusing what mode I was in based off of the quick start manual. Ambient would be if you wanted to hear more than if the ANC was just off.) For the price this is very acceptable. The more adaptable, on the fly noise cancelling algorithms are extremely difficult to implement, and hence you pay a premium for them. Overall, I would compare these to a really good pair of foam tip IEMs in terms of noise cancellation. These will definitely not provide any hearing protection for things like shooting, loud shop work, etc... so keep that in mind and use your head.Sound Quality:These are definitely a ""consumer  grade"" listening experience, which for most people won't be a bad thing. For the price I am indifferent. I would say the bass is higher than normal with more muted/muddy treble. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I would say most people would find them ""good"".  For what they cost, the sound exactly like what I would expect, better than a 20 dollar pair of headphones and not as good as a $150 dollar pair of IEMs, but your mileage may vary. For comparison with a competitor, I have some Sony wf-c500 wireless earbuds (no ANC) and these sound roughly the same, maybe slightly less clear treble and bass. I would still pick these over the Sony's because these have more features for the price and for other reasons I will list below.Other:Battery -- I think the battery life specs are roughly accurate, I get a full day on them, but haven't really pushed them to the 40 hours though. Battery life seems great, the case seems to get you maybe 2 charges. The case is nothing special, I wish the hinge had more tension in it like the Sony's so it felt more premium, I can kind of wiggle it a little bit but definitely not a deal breaker. I have yet to run them to the point where they alert you if they are low just once or they keep doing it. If they keep doing it I will update and remove a star because I don't quite understand why you would annoy the user with a message consistently for the last X% of battery (original rating is 4 stars).Size and Eartips -- these are rather large, but acceptable given the price and feature set.  They don't fit in the ear as well as the Sony ones do but they don't seem to fall out either. The Sony design fits into the ear better and ""hugs"" it so to speak, they seal better as well. I do really wish these came with a set of foam tips, they would actually compete in a different price bracket for that much, mainly because of the noise reduction. They would also help the fit. The included silicon ear tips are like the cheapest on the market, not as supple as more premium earbuds. There's nothing inherently wrong with them but they may rip after a while. I think if JBL addressed the fit (decrease the depth of the ""body"" in the ear so they seal better since there would be  less weight pulling down on the eartip) and eartips they'd have an extremely solid 50 dollar pair of earbuds.Controls -  ̶U̶n̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶I̶'̶m̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶t̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶i̶s̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶r̶o̶l̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶ ̶a̶d̶j̶u̶s̶t̶m̶e̶n̶t̶,̶ ̶m̶a̶s̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶J̶B̶L̶,̶ ̶l̶o̶o̶s̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶t̶a̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶.̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶i̶n̶v̶o̶k̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶a̶s̶s̶i̶s̶t̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶r̶a̶i̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶o̶n̶y̶ ̶e̶a̶r̶b̶u̶d̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶;̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶e̶v̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶  (UPDATE: Volume controls can be added through the app as a functionality; however, you loose the ability to change noise modes. I'm still rating 4 stars because I want both, would put 4.5 but can't. I don't see why both sides need a long press for google assistant or siri, one of these long presses could change the noise mode.) I would still pick the JBL buds because the volume steps are more gradual. I can get these to a comfortable level where with the Sony ones it always either a little too loud or a little too quiet. Other than volume I love that the controls are capacitive. Sony opted for actual push buttons in theirs which makes them unusable when laying on your side or for example working on your car, as you constantly bumping/pushing the buttons inadvertently in both cases -- so big win for the JBLs.Overall, a quality earbud for the price but improvements could be made, not sure you can find a more feature rich earbud for this price.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JLab Go Air Tones+ True Wireless Earbuds Designed with Auto On and Connect,Jlab,"...i don't know how these are only $20.  the sound quality is great for the price, but even more broadly, the VALUE IS THERE!  i have used exclusively airpods for the last five or so years, so much so that i kinda forgot that other options exist.  i was here, with one broken airpod (thanks to my dog--he's a good boy who doesn't chew on things but decided my airpod that unknowingly fell out of my pocket looked tasty, i guess?).  this stuck me only using the left one while i ""saved up"" somehow--during the holidays--for a new pair of pros.  after a week or two of using the one, it kinda dawned on me that, wait, there's more out there than just airpods lol.  my man watches a ton of tech stuff on youtube, so it's not like i was unaware, it just didn't click FOR ME that there is more out there that i could actually use!  once he turned me into an Apple girlie, i said there was no going back.  and we all know nothing works as well with Apple than more Apple, right?  it's true; the immediate connectivity and seamless pairing of airpods is unmatched.  i won't sit and pretend that's not true.  but these are a close second, as far as i can tell.  i don't listen to music at home very often, especially not in earbuds; i'm usually listening to news, podcasts, reactions, etc.  so i'm not looking for amazing sound quality by any means.  BUT THESE HAVE IT!  i put on TPAB to check and YEAH, THESE ARE GREAT!  the familiar songs i know so well weren't lost to some cheap engineering or budget components.  but for my normal use case scenario--listening to political news on a low volume while i'm working from home, listening to hip-hop media while cleaning the kitchen, or listening to reddit stories to drown out my man's snoring on those extra-loud nights, these are phenomenal.  also EXTREMELY comfortable.  i love the skin-tones they came out with, too.  that's so frickin cute and thoughtful that i had to get a pair in my own skintone even though i'm more of a white/black girlie.  it's so nice to have them blend in rather than be this white, obvious thing in my ear.  i LOVE the app--it shows the battery level, lets you check for updates MANUALLY, but also has an equalizer, CUSTOM TOUCH CONTROLS!!!!!!!!! which i of course used to mimic the touch control of airpods just for ease of use, allows you to even set a volume limit to protect your ears.  also comes with some built-in ambient noises which i am a big fan of.  and the awareness feature -- i am assuming this is maybe for people who go on walks???  or, like me, wear them a lot but still have conversations here and there.  i'm so super impressed with these LITERALLY TWENTY DOLLAR earbuds, i can't say it enough!!!i want to state that i am in no way compensated for this review, nor is this one of the increasingly-common AI-generated reviews you'll see on this platform, i am just genuinely so surprised by the quality and the comfort of these.  i think these are an amazing, affordable option for anyone who is ready to burst out of their expensive Apple comfort zone, or on a budget trying to save up for something they think is ""nicer"" (trust me...you might change your mind on that part).  these would make a wonderful gift for teens who lose things (i know all too well), or even just to have around as a backup pair.  if i were still working in an office, i'd probably buy another to keep in my desk.  they're THAT GOOD.still TBD is how well they work with a PC -- i've only used them with my phone, so far.  if i decide to try that out, i'll come back to update :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
JLab Go Air Tones+ True Wireless Earbuds Designed with Auto On and Connect,Jlab,"I bought this pair of earbuds on sale for a very reasonable price, thinking that if it does not work out as expected, I would not be too upset about it.

The device connects to my phone right away and stay connected throughout my workout.  The pair of earbuds feel relatively comfortable to wear and fits snuggly in my ear canal.  The device stayed securely in my ears most of my workout routine, but there were a few occasions I had to adjust the fitting as I felt the device slipping out of ear.  I find it useful that the device comes with a very short built-in usb-c female charging cable that tucks underneath the charging case where I do not need to carry around a charging cable and comes with multiple silicone ear tips to make the device fit to my ear canal size.

One thing I was not too thrilled about was the effort it takes to remove the earpiece out of the case.  Some reason I had hard time getting a good grip on the earpiece to remove it out of box, especially when the two earpieces are together in the case.

JLab Go Air Tones+ True Wireless Earbuds Designed with Auto On and Connect,Jlab,"I’ve been using the JLab Go Air Pop+ earbuds for about two months now, and overall I’m really impressed with what you get for the price.First off, the sound quality is very decent for budget true wireless earbuds. They’re not meant to compete with premium models, but for everyday listening—music, videos, and calls—they sound clear and punchy. The EQ3 settings are a nice bonus and actually make a noticeable difference depending on what you’re listening to. The mic is not bad.. whoever I'm talking to can hear me but there's no noise canceling at all which can be annoying if you're in a noisy environment.Battery life is another strong point. I don’t find myself charging these often, and they easily last through multiple days of casual use. The dual connect feature is convenient too, especially if you want to use just one earbud at a time.There’s no active noise canceling, but that’s expected at this price point, and honestly I didn’t miss it. Passive isolation is fine for normal use.My only minor complaint is the built-in USB-C charging cable. It works, but it’s a bit annoying having to plug the case directly into an adapter instead of using a separate cable. Not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of. Also the touch controls are a bit finicky and you have to learn the gestures for left and right buds separately.Overall, these are a great option if you’re looking for affordable, reliable earbuds with good sound and excellent battery life.

Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Cosmic Blue Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,"They sound great, they're very comfortable and don't hurt your ears, and the noise cancellation is awesome! Only drawbacks is the suction piece can turn inside out when removing from ear, and the button can be super sensitive and be affected by your hair.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Cosmic Blue Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,"I gave these a good run through and have some thoughts. I'll start with the negatives. First, these do not sound great for music. It doesn't matter how I've EQ'ed them, I could never get the bass to a level I liked. These are mainly heavy on the highs with a lack of detail in the mids. Their sound signature, even after EQ'ing, works well for calls but didn't sound great with music or music-heavy movies. Second, Lenovo doesn't make an app for Android, iOS, macOS, or anything other than Windows. You must download Lenovo's Windows app to update their firmware, adjust settings, and EQ them. Third, their touch controls are limited. There’s a glossy strip on the earbuds that seem like they’d be great for volume controls, but they only have basic tap controls that are wonky. Fourth, Atmos sounds terrible. Like every other company that tries to upscale stereo audio to faux surround sound, the results are awful sounding, and I left Atmos off. Lastly, their ANC is on par with $40 earbuds from competing brands. It’s nice that Lenovo offers ANC, but it isn’t anything to write home about and it had issues with my space heater, something earbuds from other companies (even at $40) had no issues cancelling out.Despite these negatives, there are a few positives that make these a solid purchase for PC use. They maintain a solid connection to my Lenovo and Dell PCs. I could stay within a 10ft radius without experiencing dropouts or skips, even when in Teams meetings. I didn’t have anyone complain about microphone quality or other issues. The microphone tech here was able to cancel out the space heater in my office along with other low office noises.Latency was low enough I could watch training videos and other videos without having lip sync delays. My Lenovo has Bluetooth 5.3, but my work-issued Dell system has Bluetooth 5.1 and latency was still low with it. Lenovo’s app is easy to use once you get it installed, and it always connects to the earbuds without issues. The EQ was easy to adjust from a list of pre-sets or a simple band EQ you can adjust. Like I said, I could never get the bass levels I wanted or clarity in the highs, but having an EQ is better than not (I’m looking at you, Apple).The case doesn’t have Qi charging, I wish it would, but USB C charging was quick. These earbuds were getting me about 5 hours of use with ANC on, Lenovo advertises up 7 hours without ANC enabled. Much to my surprise, these earbuds feature wear detection. It’s a simple light sensor, but it works. Take one earbud out while playing content and it will pause. You can use the earbuds independently as well.Overall, these aren’t bad if you’re looking for a pair of inexpensive earbuds to use for Teams meetings. They aren’t great for music or movies, but they’re still serviceable. These excel with calls and meetings while providing a solid connection to Windows PCs during Teams meetings, something other earbuds have issues with. I don’t recommend these for media consumption, but they are great “business” earbuds to get work done.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Cosmic Blue Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,I got these because of my laptop and initially I thought they were good headphones/earbuds for like the first week but it has been a nightmare to use these. I can only get one or the other side to connect to blue tooth. I finally fixed that and got both sides to sync together and connect to Bluetooth and within less than a week it went back to me only been able to hear from one ear bud at a time. I am not connecting it to other devices!!!! It should not be so challenging to reset the earbuds and get them both synced up and they should not revert back to only one ear bud working at time. I wish I would have returned them during the time frame to get refund or replacement but snoozed off hoping to fix them. I am disappointed.

Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Cosmic Blue Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,"I really wanted to like these earbuds.  They are a nice color, not the usual black.  The case is well made, though I would have liked a feel that was less slick, and a squared off base so it could set up on my desk.  They last about 4 hours listening to videos and audio books.  I am not one to use noise cancelling, I like to hear what is going on around me, but I did test it and there was a significant reduction in the noise in my office.  The instructions were a little lacking, there were pictures that told how to turn the earbuds and noise cancelling on/off.  I can supposedly register the earbuds, but do not see the serial number, and the only QR code on the box does not scan with my phone.  There was also mention of an app for further adjustments and updates to the earbuds, but after much searching I found it is an app for a computer, not cellphone.  This is very disappointing since I would be primarily using them at work and cannot download an app to my work computer.  After trying them out at work for 8 hours (you can use 1 bud at a time), I found them uncomfortable.  They fit very similarly to the newer apple buds, which I can't wear for the same reason.  The sound was ok.  With lower voices I didn't notice any issues, but the audio book I was listening to has a female narrator, and sounded a little tinny.  The app is supposed to allow you to make adjustments, but I cannot verify that.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Tidal Teal Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,"I gave these a good run through and have some thoughts. I'll start with the negatives. First, these do not sound great for music. It doesn't matter how I've EQ'ed them, I could never get the bass to a level I liked. These are mainly heavy on the highs with a lack of detail in the mids. Their sound signature, even after EQ'ing, works well for calls but didn't sound great with music or music-heavy movies. Second, Lenovo doesn't make an app for Android, iOS, macOS, or anything other than Windows. You must download Lenovo's Windows app to update their firmware, adjust settings, and EQ them. Third, their touch controls are limited. There’s a glossy strip on the earbuds that seem like they’d be great for volume controls, but they only have basic tap controls that are wonky. Fourth, Atmos sounds terrible. Like every other company that tries to upscale stereo audio to faux surround sound, the results are awful sounding, and I left Atmos off. Lastly, their ANC is on par with $40 earbuds from competing brands. It’s nice that Lenovo offers ANC, but it isn’t anything to write home about and it had issues with my space heater, something earbuds from other companies (even at $40) had no issues cancelling out.Despite these negatives, there are a few positives that make these a solid purchase for PC use. They maintain a solid connection to my Lenovo and Dell PCs. I could stay within a 10ft radius without experiencing dropouts or skips, even when in Teams meetings. I didn’t have anyone complain about microphone quality or other issues. The microphone tech here was able to cancel out the space heater in my office along with other low office noises.Latency was low enough I could watch training videos and other videos without having lip sync delays. My Lenovo has Bluetooth 5.3, but my work-issued Dell system has Bluetooth 5.1 and latency was still low with it. Lenovo’s app is easy to use once you get it installed, and it always connects to the earbuds without issues. The EQ was easy to adjust from a list of pre-sets or a simple band EQ you can adjust. Like I said, I could never get the bass levels I wanted or clarity in the highs, but having an EQ is better than not (I’m looking at you, Apple).The case doesn’t have Qi charging, I wish it would, but USB C charging was quick. These earbuds were getting me about 5 hours of use with ANC on, Lenovo advertises up 7 hours without ANC enabled. Much to my surprise, these earbuds feature wear detection. It’s a simple light sensor, but it works. Take one earbud out while playing content and it will pause. You can use the earbuds independently as well.Overall, these aren’t bad if you’re looking for a pair of inexpensive earbuds to use for Teams meetings. They aren’t great for music or movies, but they’re still serviceable. These excel with calls and meetings while providing a solid connection to Windows PCs during Teams meetings, something other earbuds have issues with. I don’t recommend these for media consumption, but they are great “business” earbuds to get work done.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lenovo TWS Earbuds Yoga PC Edition Tidal Teal Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds ENC 3-Mic Clear Calls AI EQ Mode Switch for Gaming,Lenovo,I got these because of my laptop and initially I thought they were good headphones/earbuds for like the first week but it has been a nightmare to use these. I can only get one or the other side to connect to blue tooth. I finally fixed that and got both sides to sync together and connect to Bluetooth and within less than a week it went back to me only been able to hear from one ear bud at a time. I am not connecting it to other devices!!!! It should not be so challenging to reset the earbuds and get them both synced up and they should not revert back to only one ear bud working at time. I wish I would have returned them during the time frame to get refund or replacement but snoozed off hoping to fix them. I am disappointed.

Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"I have been looking for a good pair of earbuds for a few months now. I have the Steel series arctic earbuds that are 150$, and four others. The Monster earbuds are better than all of them. My SS buds were great but the ANC broke after about a week. Then a month later the transparency feature suddenly made them so quiet they are not worth using. The other pairs are just mid and meh. But these Monsters have deep bass which for me is a must, and they sound fantastic! I am an avid music/podcast listener and gamer. These are perfect for all uses! They feel well made and solid! The case is great and I love the design. All of this to say they are IMO very much worth the price! I got them on a deep discount but if I had to pay Full price I would not feel ripped off like the SS arctic buds. Highly recomend! Only issue was the ear pads were too small and I had to use some from a different pair. But I have big ears lol! Once I used different pads they sound just like I had hoped.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"Been knowing about monster brand since highschool (2010) always wanted a pair but never seem to afford it. Yes later I came across them again.

But over 10/10 in sound quality, and design.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"I'm a mid grade earbud buyer and these are pretty darn good, got them for a great price for cyber Monday (close to half off) they replaced my higher end series of JBL's. The sound quality is better than the JBL vibe 100 by far. The only trade off is the volume does not get as high as the JBL's. The monsters could be a bit louder, the JBL's at full blast are too loud to tolerate to where the monsters at full blast are just nowhere near as loud. The sound quality is the key, the monsters are hands down better between lows mids and hi. The range and crystal clear sound outweighs making your ears bleed. I also thing the charging case on the monsters is a MUCH better design. Overall 5* but to be honest if I paid sticker price as opposed to half off I would be disappointed and it would fall to 3*. If you can get a good deal for them grab it!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"I'm a huge Monster Audio fan, even their lower priced items tend to have decent sound for the money you'll spend.  I really liked these, they sound great with a full range which for me is important as I listen to just about everything from early 20th jazz, Big Band from the 20's & 40's and most anything up through current selections. One problem I've had with other Bluetooth buds is they tend to fall of my ears with even slight activity but these didn't have that issue at all. I was able to wear them while working on my hobbies which include wood working as well during physical therapy which could ne fairly vigorous without having to readjust them. I especially liked that they didn't fall out while sleeping. Put them in at bedtime and still have them in at 5am.The issue I have with them and it's a big one is after several months charging became a major issue.  I tried cleaning the contacts on both the case and buds to no avail and unless I left them for a day in the case it was unlikely I'd have even half a charge. At first it was just the right ear bud but then it was both. It really became a nuisance when you'd leave them in the case for 12 hours only to find they were still at 10% the next morning. We finally gave up on them and ordered a new pair of earbuds.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"Very good ear buds. Clean, clear sound, with good fit. Fast, trouble-free connectivity.

Good value for the purchase dollar.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Monster Clarity 101 AirLinks Wireless Earbuds,Monster,"I bought these, the 700 anc and Champions because I use buds A LOT and the price on Amazon was good. The backup batteries are all across the spectrum with this one being the medium but still not great, like the Champions. Sound quality was mid pack but the not far behind the 700's. Function is perfected when it comes to thermal, too sensitive and adjustments become inadvertent actions. Form is really nice as well, i really like the framing, finish and the LED actually looks linear. Connects within a second or 2 and range is similar to skullcandy which imo has the best range I've seen. Love the L/R connectivity as well, normally I had to always carry 2 sets for work. IPX rated so I can work in them and I also like the case with the slide window. The only functions it's missing is ambient microphone and anc but for half the price of the 700's that's ok with me.Update: after using these for a few weeks I wanted to leave a few notes. Battery life on the buds are the best I've seen on individual buds. I'm usually only wearing 1 at a time but most days 1 bud will outlast the battery on my phone and I am almost always listening to something. The charging case isn't quite as good and needs to be charged every few days. The Monster Champions is a heavier case but will last literally weeks on a single charge and daily use. Despite that these are the best buds I've ever owned and I've had literally dozens. I wear these over my ANC 700's, Beats, Klipsch, several JBL's, several Skullcandy's and Sony buds. Lastly, fit is also the best I've experienced. I normally don't have problems finding buds that fit and usually use the supplied medium sized inserts but these stay in place as good as any. I'm not fumbling with them while I work outside in Texas and I love that.",5.0 out of 5 stars

realme Buds Air 7 Pro with Ai Live Translation,Realme,"I bought these earbuds primarily out of curiosity to see how the ""AI live translation"" feature worked. Overall, the earbuds themselves aren't bad, but the software that powers them leaves a lot to be desired.*The AI translation feature is present in a dedicated app menu, but the page or tab simply doesn't work at all after selecting the mode and languages.*The app itself demands many different permissions, including your location, microphone, and nearby devices. While microphone and nearby device access can somewhat be explained, sharing your location makes absolutely no sense, yet the app won't proceed without it. This prevents you from adjusting the sound mixer or even attempting to use the non-functional AI translation.*Noise cancellation works, but if there's any wind, you'll experience light clicking or crackling in your ear.*The earbuds come with additional eartip sizes. With the medium-sized tips, the earbuds shift around in my ears while walking, creating strange clicking noises. With the large tips, the earbuds simply fall out of my ears after 5-8 minutes of walking.For this price, not worth right now. In theory, for around $50-60, they'd be decent earbuds, as the material quality and sound are not bad at all.",2.0 out of 5 stars

realme Air 6 True Wireless Earbuds,Realme,"The battery life is honestly amazing!Sounds quality truly good.My only complaint is there is no equalizer option for iPhones so you can’t customize anything.I also dislike that if you just put 1 earphone in then it starts off with transparency mode and you must switch it to normal. There is no option to turn off this “feature” so they will always start off as transparent first, and that’s for all products regardless if you have android or anything else.Overall great but gets annoying if you take your headphone on and off a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Wireless Earbuds,Rinsmola,"For someone hard-of-hearing like myself, these are the answer to my prayers.  Didn't have to spend a boatload of money, either.  Frankly, I don't know how they can sell them so reasonably.  I had a pair of large, with full ear cups, bluetooth headphones to listen to TV.  My wife doesn't like the high volume so I had to wear them all the time during the day / evening with the TV audio muted when watching unless we were watching a movie / TV program she wanted to watch with me.  Now I can hear her and the TV simultaneously so she doesn't have to yell at me to override the old headphones.  The audio is perfect.  The old headphones were extremely poor for high frequencies and were very heavy with the bass.  Without the high frequencies everything sounded muffled and forget trying to understand what foreign actors are trying to say on my favorite shows.  I could understand 20-40% of what they were saying no matter how loud I had the headphones jacked up and background music in the film / TV show just made it all that much worse.  No longer!  Great audio, lots of high frequency response so I can watch everything now and understand all the words being spoken.  These work great for music, too, on my iPhone and MacBook devices.  I bought a bluetooth transmitter on Amazon (1Mii SafeFly Dual | Bluetooth 5.3 Adapter Bluetooth Transmitter w/Screen for Wireless Headphones), plugged the 3mm audio plug into the headphone jack on the TV and away we went after pairing.  The SafeFly transmitter mentioned comes with a USB charging port so I just plugged it into a USB to AC adapter into the outlet behind the TV so it remains fully charged at all times.  These are great for the hard-of-hearing like myself.",5.0 out of 5 stars

SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro R190 Bluetooth Earbuds True Wireless,Samsung,Not bad at all for refurbished! Connected with ease and they sound awesome! Thank you!,5.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro R190 Bluetooth Earbuds True Wireless,Samsung,"I upgraded to these after losing my beloved Galaxy Buds+ and was mildly disappointed. After using these for three or four years, I have since moved on to the much happier pair of Galaxy Buds3.Compared to buds I've had before and after, the fit for these was the worst. They would easily slip out of my ears (regardless of which earbud-tip size I attached.) They also hurt to wear, after a while.Something about the case's shape also meant that any time I dropped it, it opened and launched the earbuds into oblivion. They were never damaged, so I guess in that sense it did its job. But it's an awkward thing when it happens, for example, on an airplane.(While we're on the subject: Side-sleepers, beware, these are not the earbuds for you. They stick out too much for that and it hurts.)Battery life is about, eh, 2 - 3 hours. If it starts to die in use, you can keep the case charged and put one bud in there and just keep alternating them.One thing I'm really impressed by is their water-resistance. My cat pushed the case and buds into his water bowl, and after setting them out to dry for a day they functioned as normal.To their credit, the sound is great. They also have intuitive and useful touch-controls, and their noise cancelling is pretty decent. But the other aspects outweighed this for me, I think.The Good:- Sound is great- Touch controls are easy and work well- Noise-canceling is decent- Fantastic water resistanceThe bad:- Short battery life- Pretty uncomfortable to wearThe Ugly:- Them",3.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"I don’t usually write reviews, but I felt compelled to share how impressed I am with these headphones! I have small ears, and most earbuds never stay in place. The only ones that worked for me in the past were the Bose SoundSport. After that, I used Beats Pro over-ear headphones. While they stayed on, I was never truly impressed with the sound quality.I spent weeks researching before purchasing these, and I’m so glad I did. They fit comfortably in my small ears and stay put without any issues. The active noise cancellation is excellent—at the gym, I used to hear conversations and background noise through my old headphones, but with these properly seated, I hear NOTHING at all!The sound quality and clarity are a noticeable upgrade from my old Beats, and I really like being able to adjust the sound through the app. I prefer bass-heavy music, and these deliver. While volume controls on the earbuds themselves would be nice, it’s not a deal breaker since my phone is usually nearby.If you struggle with earbuds staying in your ears and want a high-quality pair of headphones that cost about half the price of other major brands—while performing even better in my opinion—I highly recommend giving these a try!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Samsung Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"These are great sounding earbuds and they are fantastic for the price. You really can't get any better. I specifically needed these though because I need a good transparency mode and I didn't want to spend too much for earbuds. I have nicer earbuds that have much better noise canceling but The trade-off with the other earbuds that I have tried was that they had a poor transparency mode so it seems like at this price you kind of get one of the other. The noise canceling isn't terrible on these earbuds it's just that if that is what you want more than anything you can get better on different earbuds. So again if you're looking for a good all-around earbud with great transparency mode go with these. I should also note I have smaller ears and although they are a little bit bulky they fit and they do not fall out. A little tip though, twist them a little bit to get them to grab onto your ear just right.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"These Galaxy buds fe are almost perfect.As an audiophile these definitely sound great, a bit of treble sparkle, slightly boosted mids and BASS. While I personally think they sound better than the Method 360 ANC by Skullcandy, they have quite a ways to go to become the perfect earbud.The battery life is not the greatest as I only get 5-6 hours with ANC on. And about 22-24 with the case.The fit is very good, I'm glad to see a stability fin on these. Not only does it make them fit better, but man do the look good. Also speaking of the fin, they do stay in the ear very well, and with their IPX2 rating I've had them drenched in sweat and snow and everything still works so prompts to Samsung.The ANC is good enough as it reduces background noise and softens conversations around.The app experience is very cool, one thing is I downloaded the Wearable app and was told that the app was not needed and that I could access everything from the settings app on my S23. Don't know if it was a UI update or something, but all very cool.Two things. One, the ANC stays off until you go into the settings and change it yourself, so you can have ANC in just one  earbud.Two, the wear detection works but it takes the earbuds a second to realize its not in my ear. Also just a general note I'd like to have a company who makes an earbud with wear detection and it just pauses the earbud you took out and not both earbuds.Overall they are very good earbuds and will be great for a casual listener who wants a Samsung product. These are great!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Samsung Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"Recently purchased these because a older set of wireless earbuds I had started to glitch out in the left ear wouldn't charge properly. So bit  bullet and bought these and I'm glad I did. They were easy to connect. They charge great. They fit in the ear perfectly and come with sized earbuds and a few other attachments from outside the ear when the earbuds are in  to adjust for comfort. wasn't too deep in Pocket (if you choose to do a monthly payment plan like I did) comes in into simple yet pretty good looking colors. I must say black and white. I chose white so I can find them even in their case in the case itself fits in the palm of the hand very comfortably and I omit I am bad with taking the earbuds out of the case and sometimes holding the case itself, but in having had these for a bit. I did fumble the case and it didn't fly open which is a blessing The functions in the earbuds themselves are very simple, personally I have absolutely no care that they don't do volume control for me. It's starting stopping and just moving on to the next song and answering calls. They are very excellent for that. They work great. Oh, and let's not forget the sound quality and noise cancellation. It doesn't drown out the environment around you, but it gives a perfect balance of quiet and self-awareness where you can enjoy what you're listening to and not be completely unaware of what's going on around you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The voice command for volume is useless, though, because it only changes by a tiny bit, so you would have to keep saying it repeatedly. It would be better if you could say to set the volume at XX%.

SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"I have every wireless earbud model that Samsung has made thus far. I cannot recommend Galaxy Buds 2 Pro enough.The sound is remarkable, simply put.Turning on the 360 audio feature on them changes everything, I don't even know how it's possible to feel like the sound is coming from everywhere besides the things sitting in your ears.The active noice canceling is shocking, it's substantially better than just a generation ago in the buds 2.  My window is right next to a main road in my town, and I can sit right in front of it, watching cars go by 15 feet away, without anything playing in the earbuds, and not hear the cars at all. Blows my mind.Generally buds with wingtips fit best in my ears, and they give me more confidence wearing them in active conditions, jogging, biking, cleaning, etc. The Buds 2 never stayed in my ears very well, constant adjustments, the Buds Pro were even worse, and produced unbearable pain in my ears due to their size, geometry, and weight. I was frankly expecting a similar outcome with these Buds 2 Pro, I was instead very surprised to find out that they fit and stay in my ears better than even the Buds FE and other wingtipped buds. I can wear them indefinitely without discomfort, and rarely have to adjust their position in my ears. I do not know how they pulled this off. They are noticeably lighter than previous buds, this surely plays a role.  (I understand the fitment will vary by individual)Battery life is also perfectly sufficient for most people's listening habits, I would imagine. The old Buds+ and their 11+ hours have spoiled me though, and leave me wanting more with all the Buds I've had since, but, I can't really complain with these specifically, ~6 hours is a fine tradeoff if it means lighter buds with better drivers.I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell you why these sound great, but they do, that is certain.HIGHLY recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"This is the perfect design! I love the design as it perfectly fits and stay in the ear. No risk of falling down during run/work out. The sound quality is superb and branded by AKG and the price is reasonable specifically as Samsung always gives special offer! The volume control cannot be done through the buds, but it is okay and perfect. I found the battery life enough for at least one day and use of usb type-c port and wireless charging is another plus point I could consider!",5.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"I have always used cheaper Bluetooth wireless headsets for my phone, but on a recent trip to Utah I decided to splurge. I don't know why I didn't sooner. These are super comfortable in the ears and the noise canceling is absolutely amazing. I would compare it to my Bose headphones that I wear when I'm at home in the quality of the noise canceling. If you pair them with a Samsung phone, you get even more additional features that are just mind blowing compared to your cheap Bluetooth headsets.So I leave it in this if you have a Samsung Galaxy Device absolutely think about spending the money and buying a set of fees you will not regret it. Only one complaint I have, the flip up lid of the charger case comes open very easily, every now and then you'll lose the headphones in your pocket or if you drop the case they will go flying. They have even bounced off into puddles and into a toilet at one point. Drive them off quickly and both of them have still worked for month since I got them. Other than the case I have nothing bad to say about these things can't wait to see the next iteration.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"Bought these as an upgrade from mid - level Jlab wireless headphones. The primary reason that I wanted an upgrade from my old Jlab headphones was the quality of making calls. Honestly other than that I had no issues with my old ones. After buying these I tested the sound quality for calls. IT MAKES PHONE CALLS WITH SUPER GOOD QUALITY. It did exactly what I had got them for! I was a little sad however, to realize that the noise cancelling mode had actually decreased in quality. Initially I could not tell a difference between regular off mode and noise cancelling. Then I discovered I had some bigger ear tips. This did make a decent difference, however the noise cancelling just still never was as good as my old headphones (and to be honest they were not like the most insane at it either). I think I'm gonna try and find some better tips online that will help with noise cancelling and see what happens.Overall:Phone call quality: AMAZINGTec and features: A little sensitive but overall really well doneOverall feel in the ears etc: Not bad at allNoise cancelling mode: Mid at bestAmbient Noise mode: GreatWorth the upgrade from $70 Jlab wireless headphones: Overall yes",4.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"I upgraded to these after owning the Galaxy Buds Live, which is a very different design. I'm not an audiophile, but I am fairly experienced with mid-tier sound equipment, speakers, and headphones. I built my own 11.1 surround sound movie room using a higher end Yamaha receiver and have used Klipsch, Polk Audio, Paradigm, BIC America, Sony, Yamaha, Pioneer, Bose (don't judge me, they work well in some applications), JL Audio, JBL, Mirage, and other brands of speakers through the years in home and car audio setups. For headphones, I've mainly used wired as early wireless models sounded hollow and tinny in comparison. I've used lower end AKG and Sony buds, as well as mid-tier Sennheisers. I've also used higher end Sony over-ear headphones as well as the highly rated (but lesser known) Status Audio CB-1 studio monitor headphones.I waited a while to buy into the wireless headphone market and finally took the plunge with the Buds Live as they offered something my wired headphones didn't—ambient sound. Usually this is an unwanted distraction and noise isolation is preferred, but sometimes I want to be aware of what's going on around me and be able to engage in a conversation even if I have my buds in. Apple did this well with their pass-through technology, but I'm not about to switch over to an entirely new product line and closed ecosystem just for headphones, so I waited. The Buds Live managed this trick with a low-tech solution by not sealing in the ear canal, so I gave them a try. Sound quality was decent—on par with my lower end AKG wired buds, but not as good as my mid-tier (~$100) Sennheiser buds. They also were finnicky with their connection and cut out a lot if my phone was in my pocket, especially if I bent over or squatted.BUDS 2 PRO:I upgraded to these as they also had a pass-through feature which seemed to work fairly well and did so automatically when you started talking. I figured this would be just as good and offer better sound and isolation when desired. Overall I think this feature works pretty good and is a nice compromise for me. In terms of sound quality, the Buds 2 Pro are definitely a step up from the Buds Live and probably on par with my wired mid-tier Sennheisers. I can't complain about the sound quality at all.As with the Buds Live though, the Buds 2 Pro require a bit of fidgeting to get them seated in the ear properly. Traditional ear buds, and even Apple's Airpods require little thought or adjustment beyond getting the right sized rubber or foam tips for a good seal. Samsung seems to go for more experimental designs which require learning and getting used to. After a few days use, they still aren't ""natural"" to put in or locked into muscle memory—I have to fuss with them a bit to get a good seal. Once in though, I haven't had any problems.Overall, I recommend these buds. They still aren't perfect as the fit isn't intuitive, battery life a little meager, and the noise cancellation is about 85-90%, not 100, but overall, solid headphones. Could you get way better sounding wired headphones for tons less money? Yes, for about $50 you can pick up a pair of Status CB-1's and hear every fine detail in high fidelity. But in the wireless in-ear category, prioritizing convenience and mobility over everything else, these perform admirably. I've heard Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3 buds *might* edge these out in terms of sound quality, but they look a lot more bulky (stick out more from the ear and therefore may be less stable) and don't have the automatic ambient sound pass-through feature. They also are a touch more money. On the upside though, they appear to be a more traditional bud design, so might be more straightforward to put in, but Airpods are probably still the easiest to put in and take out.But I plan on using the Buds 2 Pro for years before feeling the need to upgrade again. I'm satisfied with the purchase, though still wincing at the cost-to-performance ratio compared to wired options. Can't knock a product for performing in the top tier of its specific market though, so I'll give it 5 stars as a true wireless earbud, but would give it 4 in sound quality against cheaper wired in-ear and over-ear options.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"I have had these for 3 yrs now.  I use them almost daily as a construction worker.  With no music playing it actually makes it easier to talk to people because the noise cancelling cuts out all the background noise.  I often wear them just as ear plugs with no audio at all.  They work better than foam plugs for grinding or other loud tasks.  If I have music playing on top of the noise canceling I basically cannot hear anything but the music and these sound great.  I was adverse to ear buds for a long time until I bought these.  I always preferred over ear headphones.  The ""jelly bean"" style is very nice and with 3 cup sizes in the box its easy to get a good fit.  They do have a poor battery life but it last long enough to get me to break and then they go in the car.  They charge fast so its no issue really and given how much work they are doing with the noise canceling its no surprise they are heavy on battery usage.  I do not use voice detect because I found that WILL kill your battery if you intend to use these for work all day.  The augmented audio feature is also very cool.  Nice for hunting.  I clean them cups and screens often with a q tip.  One soaked in peroxide and then one soaked in alcohol.  They have maintained great audio clarity over the years despite heavy use in the very tough environment of an outdoor construction site during all seasons in Michigan.

I love this because I have the Z Fold 5, been a phablet x stylus user since Note 2! There are so many reasons to invest in this earbuds, most especially if you're a Samsung user.First, it just integrates with my phone intuitively and I can use it with my MacBook 2017 and Garmin Fenix 6s! The Wearable widget helps reconnect the earbuds back to the phone faster than fumbling with the app. I can continue listening to a song or podcast on Spotify from my phone to my laptop and back to my phone, and the sound quality and volume doesn't change.Second, the connectivity is sustained better than other wireless earbuds, whether watching a video, listening, or gaming! There's a gaming option that minimizes the lag between the sound and game action. I can leave my phone farther and still listen to music, or more important, get calls while doing tasks more than 20 feet or more away - even between 2 rooms apart. I had cheaper buds that once I close our steel-cored front door, the connection with my phone will be disrupted even if my phone is just right next to the door.Third, I love the responsiveness to equalizer adjustments! I'm not a sound engineer or audiophile but I used their reviews to narrow down my options based on the products that produce the best sound qualities on the range of frequencies I can already hear with my naked ears. We appreciate sounds differently so it depends on individual hearing but we'd agree that these pricey things respond fast! My hearing was tested, I'm also trained in classical music, and have a healthcare background, so my ears seek refined details from music or physiological sounds. I don't like too much enhanced bass and uncomfortable loudness, as those can lead to deafness. These buds can be loud and bass-proud too! Fresh from the box, these buds were on Normal settings on the Wearable equalizer. To me, I heard the lower frequencies more than the higher ones but I can still distinctly appreciate the higher registers. So I tweaked the equalizer and it responds immediately!!! That equalizer doesn't allow customization but Spotify allows it. I noticed that the Dynamic option looks like the Harman Curve, whether you're a fan of it or not, it's preset already. Although with these earbuds, I can tell if music has been rendered with Dolby, HiFi or some technology... some music do sound unnatural. I had to check the music piece I'm studying if I heard the musical dynamics right, as I might be attempting to produce that sound quality in real life.Now, the stuff I don't like... first, these were so uncomfortable at the start. I can't bear these in my ears for 30 minutes when I first got it. I had to stretch my earlobes and wear these for staggered periods of time per day. I mixed and matched between small and mid-sized tips until the buds fit test say they're ok and it does feel comfortable. It took me a week to adjust my ears and now I can wear them 4 to 6 hours straight. I almost returned these but I thought I'm used to having wired earphones and it's the sacrifice to wireless earbuds that do work. Just like others advice, do the fit test frequently until the fit feels right.Second, the charging case isn't waterproof and shockproof, so I bought the Samsung armor for it. Both the buds and case get dusty pretty quickly. I clean the tips and case with alcohol and tissue.Third, I don't like that it's protruding out of my earlobes but it is what it is. As of this writing, it's one of the smaller and lighter earbuds. I've tried working out and doing sports with these, they pop out when I clench my jaw, move my head in many directions or jump.

SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds3 Pro (2024,Samsung,"These buds are a big let-down, especially since they are priced and positioned to be the top buds Samsung makes. I'm into personal tech, and I own way too many Apple and Samsung devices. I currently use a Samsung Galaxy Fold 7, and that is the phone I've been using with these buds. I also currently own the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and I also have Apple Earpods Pro as well (also used the Samsung buds with Ipad Pros and Window laptops)Unfortunately, from a reliability stand point, the Apple Earpods Pro work better with my Samsung phone than Samsung's own ear buds.Issues:1. My right ear bud just stopped charging and connecting. I've charged, pulled the bud in and out of the case, pushed it in, re-paired, reset, and I cannot get the right ear bud to charge or connect. Just period, right now, after days of messing with it, the right ear bud doesn't work. I've had these buds for like 3 months.2. Pairing doesn't always activate. Generally, to pair, you open the case and hold the pair button for a few seconds, and it's supposed to enter pairing mode. Unfortunately, with these buds, that process has not worked on several occasions. I noticed this issue seems to happen more often when the buds connect to a previously paired device, and then you try to pair to a new device. Probably a software bug, but common, these are the Pros, and should not have these issues. For comparison, I've never had a pairing issue with my Airpods Pros, Apple or Android device.3. Mic/voice dropouts. On several occasions, when answering a phone call, or doing a Teams call, the audio would work, but the mic would not. The bluetooth settings would say everything is connected (both audio and mic), but for whatever reason, the mic-audio would not work. Probably another software setting, but it happened to me on a couple important work-related calls, and it's one of those things that really makes you lose confidence in the buds. I've had this happen once with the Airpods Pros, but only once.Good things:1. As a techy person, I really liked the LED lights on the blade portion of the buds.2. When it works, big caveat, when it works, the integrated world of Samsung devices is nice (e.g. auto-switch between devices, battery levels, customization, etc).3. I like the look of the case and buds better than the Apply buds.Would I buy again? No. If you're debating between the Samsung buds Pro and the Apply buds Pro, even if you're an Android user, I would recommend going with the Apple Buds Pro.",1.0 out of 5 stars

SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds3 Pro (2024,Samsung,"I have tried a handful of Bluetooth ear buds and have used airpods pro 2 as my daily drivers for the past 2yrs. These sound better and from what I can tell the mics do a better job at noise isolation. There are things that samsung really should change on the next iteration of these. The way they seat into the case could have been better, the angle they sit at I have to turn the ear buds 180 degrees to put them in my ear when pulling them from the case. The triangular shaped stems make it so you have to put them back into the case a certain angle and requires more effort from the user versus with a rounded stem you just get the stem partialy in the case and then the built in magnets helping get them orientated and seated correctly. When adjusting them in my ears, I almost every time hit the haptic button built into the stems that pauses the music. They should have put more thought into the colors. I intentionally didn't go with the white because I didn't want them to look like my previous airpods but the silver color with the blue and red tabs on the bottom makes them look pretty chintzy. At a $250 MSRP directly competing with airpods, it's very disappointing that the case doesn't have the ultra-wideband built in to be able to use the radar like feature from your phone to find them. The find my feature relies on the buds being out of the case and reliant on chirping noise from the buds to find them. I had to buy a samsung smart tag to attach to the protective case carabiner so I could have this feature. Volume is great on these, they are as loud, if not slightly louder then airpods. I find that battery life on these are excellent. With ANC on the battery is around 6hrs and way longer if you have ANC off.",3.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"It works great! I bought it refurbished and it definitely an upgrade from the original Buds Pro! Better noise canceling, sound and better design as well! It does work with older models such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. The case fells so nice but can easily get scratched if left in pocket with car keys and other hard objects. Battery life is not bad at all, as both buds can last 2+ hours or more, even if you you use it longer and the battery dies out, it charges super quickly. The case should charge the earbuds 3 around full battery cycles, more or less. I've read reviews  about the bad comfort from the Buds 3 so I chose this one, refurbished.

I am sure if you find some in good condition you will agree.Tech KingsThis is the seller which I purchased these from.  They were clean and pound just as hard as my first pair.

SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"Bought on 02/15/25 at about 11:55pm and it came fast...it was here by 02/16/25 between 8-10am.I'm coming from using the ""Samsung Galaxy Buds+"" and ""Samsung Galaxy Buds2"" which i have had for 5 and 4yrs+ respectively. I love to stick with things and i love comfort and i don't like the unpredictability of new things.My Samsung Buds2 tip got spoiled plus it's no longer as loud, while working out last week, the left side of my Buds+ went out. I did everything i could and even called Samsung to no avail. I have small ears and so i really loved my previous buds. I was really apprehensive towards these ones being that they don't look as compact as the last ones I own. When i got them, they did not have the original box, so i was even more apprehensive and thought to myself I will surely be returning this. BUT, upon opening it, it was clean and no visible damage or anything.So far, the sound quality blew my mind immediately i put it on, I got chills. Also, upon taking a picture of it on my S24+ to leave this review, it automatically gave me option to pair(interesting). I hadn't had it on for long before the battery ran out but i can't comment on this because i do not know if it was fully charge(update later on this).The fit is also something I'll have to get used to as my ears are small(I loved the fit of the Buds+ better). It also has some settings that are not available on the other sets i have such as-""Voice Detect""(reduces volume if it detects your voice incase you are having a conversation while listening so you don't have to take them off)-""Head tracking""(adjusts volume according to how you turn your head)-Neck Stretch reminders(incase you bend your head too much looking at your screen).Now i waiting a few days to post this review( 03/02/25). I'd have to say although i really love the sound quality, but i have to constantly adjust it in my ears alot more than i did my last two especially when i go jogging/running. Literally every few seconds. Annoying...but I don't think I'll return it because i don't have a better audio option for the price point at this time. Also, it doesn't have the volume touch controls like the previous ones.07/06/25: Update.This is a long overdue update. Now i get why it was on refurbished sale. The earbuds are horrible for calls which are very important for me. No one can here me on the phone if i use them which is pretty annoying since it was one of the most important reasons i bought them.",3.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"I had a Buds Pro I got a few years ago, and then I guess they fell out of my pocket while I was out because they're gone. So I got these.Fit feels a little better than the Pros did, but I'm probably imagining that. Connects to the wear app easily and well, allowing control such as changing from surround sound to ambient sounds. Love that you can turn off touch controls. My ears are garbage at holding buds in so I constantly have to push them back in. (It's not an incorrectly sized ear-tip. Large is way too big, medium doesn't get a perfect grip. Broken ears.)I will admit I haven't tried the call option, as I seldom get calls, and haven't at all while wearing them. I do know the original Pros worked great though. Just tested it calling someone. Both of us noticed no sound issues. They didn't know I wasn't using my phone and they sounded normal to me.I am kinda sad color-wise. The original Pros had a like, glittery-ness to them, the the buds themselves were mirror-like. These are just a plain pastel purple, which I still like but don't think is as pretty. However, I think part of that is the material on the outside of the box is more tacky. The originals were smooth, and I imagine the change was to keep them from easily falling out of your pocket. The biggest issue is, if you have the white or purple, they smudge visibly easier.I had hoped that the find your earbuds option was for if you misplaced the whole thing, but it's simply for if you drop a bud and cant find it, which is disappointing.I can't give a good estimate on battery life. I just spent the past twenty minutes in a call and  the buds went down 5% I don't use them a lot because I'm disabled so I don't go out much, and I've never looked at the battery% once I was done. I will say my box is still at 21% after using them for probably around 15-18 hours, so that's not bad at least.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds w/ Noise Cancelling,Samsung,"It works great! I bought it refurbished and it definitely an upgrade from the original Buds Pro! Better noise canceling, sound and better design as well! It does work with older models such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. The case fells so nice but can easily get scratched if left in pocket with car keys and other hard objects. Battery life is not bad at all, as both buds can last 2+ hours or more, even if you you use it longer and the battery dies out, it charges super quickly. The case should charge the earbuds 3 around full battery cycles, more or less. I've read reviews  about the bad comfort from the Buds 3 so I chose this one, refurbished. Good as new!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Wireless Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"About 5 years ago Samsung released the legendary Galaxy Buds Live in August of 2020I was fortunate enough to be able to receive buds live with an s22 ultra from Samsung in 2021, those buds have been my daily driver's since thenWe are talking all day long from work, to the ride home and throughout my night and even through sleep on some occasionsFinding a replacement for the buds live is challenging, I was not lucky enough to grab a new pair at retail before they were discontinued and my old buds have various issues between charging to audio quality but now is the time they get replacedThe new buds 3 were a somewhat confusing decision only due to Amazon having a separate more expensive version with a two year warranty and some issue with shipping but whateverAfter my first use I am very blown away, I have only turned them up to about 1/3 the max volume but they are noticeably louder than my buds live which have to be turned up until two notches past the volume warning to hear under certain circumstancesThe fit in the ear is much better due to the larger design and the speaker hole is also bigger so the sound isn't so cannedThe price was ok about 100 but I can't speak for the battery life or anything else yetIf there was one thing I don't like it's the stem controls but in comparison to the buds live with a touch sensor on the exterior that always didn't function correctly... Even with touches blocked it would still hang up calls so I had to use good lock to make a custom event where if I double tap the power button it enabled touches blocked but I had to do this Everytime I switch earphones or if I go from a video to answering a call it would re enable touchesI paired my buds with a locking case from Spigen. Not happy that you have to glue the top on but Spigen gives you a spare adhesive strip and so far it doesn't seem like it will come apart easily",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Wireless Earbud Headphones,Samsung,"TLDR; These are great, even at MSRP. I wish I bought these when they came out. Sale prices make these a no brainer, especially for those that don't want rubber tips in their ears. Battery life is decent and all play/pause and volume swipe functions work in Windows 11 without the app installed.This will include comparisons to AirPods 4 ANC:I've been using AirPods 4 on my PC for a while and they've worked fine.  My personal gripe is that the stem doesn't have the volume swipe gestures like the AirPods Pro 2/3.  Maybe Apple will add this for AirPods 5 in the future, but guess what these have now. That's right, I can now adjust volume as well.Fitment will depend of the person, like most earbuds, but these feel just slightly larger in general so in my case, they fit fine.Sound quality seems fine.  I'm no audiophile but these sound good with a hint more bass than the Airpods but I believe this can be adjusted.Wireless charging works like it should and I've got some Ringke cases on the way to get them to latch on to magsage chargers.Note, there is software for Windows 11 already and it looks basic but it seemingly gives you a better idea of the buds battery life instead of the built in Windows bluetooth page staying at 100% until you reconnect them to reflect the actual battery life. And speaking of, battery life is good.  Granted these are brand new but they seemingly went the full 5-6 hours when switching noise cancelling on and off.I initially thought these had a transparency mode but looks like these simply don't.  So the Airpods 4 ANC get a slight edge, but I'm taking the volume control over that.  I would love for these to come out in a variety of colors, not just because options would be nice, but since I've got two pairs, the different colors would make it much more obvious which pair goes where. That's another thing the Ringke cases will help with.Well done Samsung.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,Samsung,"Actually worth the price. The pinch function works great, the ANC is great, the volume is spectacular, and they fit in my ear for my 6 mile run today and didn't fall out even remotely (despite that i sweat a lot). The case is compact and everything is very well built, although the case feels a bit ""plastic-y"". Just be cautious with that. They are pretty comfortable as well, the M size nibs fit for me. The connectivity is of course very quick and took me less than a minute to set it up right. No fooling around with EQs necessarry either- for most. They sound fantastic out the box. If you're a bit of an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate the experience for all genres. I suspect if you like a lot of hip hop/rap/pop/electronic music you may want to hike up the bass and scoop the mids a bit. And for rock/metal/country/jazz/classical these will sound great as is but i lowered the 4k a bit and boosted the 63 and 125 to give it a slight bump in bass still for personal preference. Highly recommend overall, especially if you have a Samsung as it fits well into the ecosystem.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Fan Edition(FE) SM-R400,Samsung,"These work great. The sound quality is great & I love the noise canceling feature. Though you do need the Samsung Wear app to control them - activate / deactivate the noise canceling feature. Since I keep my phone's Bluetooth turned off, I love the feature where after you take the buds out of their case and put them in your ear, you get a message on your phone asking if you want to connect them. I don't have to manually turn on the Bluetooth. The only drawback it seems is that I can't really use them with my Samsung TV. Although they connect and I can hear the sound, after a bit the sound starts to make digital distortions. But, no such issues when connected to the phone. The battery life is great and lasts up to ~6 hours on the buds. The case can charge the buds a few times before it itself requires charging. The Wear app shows the percentage of charge remaining for both the buds as well as the case. And unlike some other types of buds, these are essy to take out of the case.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome bass and great highs and mids (the mids could be marginally better as opposed to Pro's 2 and 3) but not enough to justify 3x the price of these. Really nice that you can turn off ANC and check both earbud and cae charge level through your phone.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Fan Edition(FE) SM-R400,Samsung,"I bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE), and let me just say, these are NOT your average earbuds. These are the superhero of sound, the Beyoncé of Bluetooth, the James Bond of noise-canceling—basically, they’re everything I never knew I needed in my life, and now I can’t live without them.The Pros:Active Noise-Canceling? More Like Active Life-Changing – I thought noise-canceling was just a “cool feature,” but NO. These babies don’t just block out the noise, they block out your ENTIRE LIFE. Kids yelling? Gone. Your neighbor’s dog barking at 3 AM? Not even a whisper. The sound of your own thoughts? Who needs them? These buds don’t let anything in… except for your favorite jams.Earbuds that Fit Like They’re Meant to Be – If you’ve ever bought earbuds that feel like they’re trying to escape your ears mid-jog, then you know the struggle. These? Fit like a glove (except for your ears, obviously, but you get the point). No slipping, no adjusting, no awkwardly trying to pop them back in when you’re about to give a TED Talk on the importance of “Listening to Your Favorite Playlist” (seriously, these fit that snug).Sound Quality That Makes You Feel Like You’re in a Concert Hall – Every note is crisp, every beat is beyond satisfying, and I swear I could hear the microwave beep in a whole new way. These Galaxy Buds make your favorite music sound like it was made in a recording studio with actual magic. If you want to feel like a rockstar while doing your laundry, these are the buds for you.Touch Controls Are So Futuristic, I Feel Like I’m In a Sci-Fi Movie – I didn’t know I needed touch controls until I had them. Want to change the song? Just tap the side. Volume too loud? Swipe down like you're controlling the volume of your future robot overlords. I can practically feel my IQ going up with every tap.Battery Life That Lasts Longer Than My Attention Span – I’ve used these buds for hours and hours, and they still had juice left. It’s like they run on pure, unadulterated energy. I’ve forgotten to charge them overnight and still had a full day of listening ahead of me. The only thing they can’t do is remind me to charge my phone… but that’s probably coming in the next edition.The Cons:I Might Become a Music Snob – I never realized how bad my old earbuds were until I put these in. Now, I’m like, “Oh, this song was supposed to sound like that?” It’s like hearing your favorite song for the first time all over again. Prepare to get snobby about sound quality and turn your nose up at anything less than “active noise-canceling perfection.”Once You Put Them In, You Might Never Leave Your House – Seriously, I put these in while cleaning, and suddenly, I was two hours deep into a podcast and forgot I had even started the dishes. These buds make doing mundane tasks feel like you're in a high-budget music video. Be careful—you might forget how to exist in the real world.Conclusion:The SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE) have elevated my audio game in a way I didn’t know was possible. They cancel noise, they amplify sound, and they make me feel like I could conquer the world (or at least my to-do list) while jamming out to my favorite tunes.If you want earbuds that make you feel like a VIP at a private concert, buy these. If you want to block out your neighbor’s questionable karaoke sessions, buy these. And if you just want to listen to your Spotify playlist like it was meant to be heard—you guessed it—buy these.TL;DR: These are the best earbuds I’ve ever had, and I now believe they might be secretly part of a government experiment to make us all smarter, more productive, and significantly cooler. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Samsung Galaxy Buds Fan Edition(FE) SM-R400,Samsung,"I'm a huge researcher when purchasing items online and I'm happy for that with these earbuds. In my opinion, these are a steal because they have the same quality sound, and noise canceling as the $300 ones at a fraction of the price. They stay perfectly in my ears and the battery life is over 6 hours even when listening at higher volumes nonstop. Save some money and go for these. You won't be disappointed",5.0 out of 5 stars
Samsung Galaxy Buds Fan Edition(FE) SM-R400,Samsung,Purchased for my daughter.  She has used them a lot and really likes them.  Good sound quality and fit.  She likes them better than the original Samsung buds she had prior to these.  Build quality is solid.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds -Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones for Music and Calls with ANC,Sennheiser,"So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The ""Bass Boost"" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean. You can eq the treble back in, but someone like Sennheiser should have a better solution than that with their software.The bluetooth range is not great with my Samsung S21 Ultra. With my old Jaybird Tarah pro's which are several years old, I could leave my phone in the garage and walk to the back yard and stay connected. with these I barely get to the end of driveway b4 they start cutting out (maybe 30ish feet or so). Not a big deal for me since I'm almost always near the phone when working, but if you are routinely farther away, might be something to consider.All in all they have been a great upgrade for me and I'm definitely hanging on to them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds -Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones for Music and Calls with ANC,Sennheiser,"I never do reviews of products, but in this case I will because of the price of this product. In the past I bought  cheap earbuds. Mostly because I use them for the gym. In the car I usually connect my phone to the radio to listen to the music, so no reason to use while driving. The most expensive brand that I bought was the DR Dre powerbeats. Decent sound at a decent price and great for the gym because they have the hook and will not fall off when exercising. But almost immediately they started having issues with charging. So then I got the Jabra elite 75T. I still have them, no issues with charging, great Bluetooth connectivity, decent active noise cancellation and decent sound. Im happy with them and still work good for the price. I paid $179 in amazon. But I wanted more regarding the sound quality so I started looking at reviews on You Tube and found the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3. Great sound, decent ANC, decent battery and connectivity. I compared them to Sony, Bose and Jabra and decided on the Sennheiser. Well, here we go....-Sound is amazing, very happy with them- Battery is as expected, I imagine base on the size of the buds, and sound they are putting out.- Wind noise will affect this buds, even with the software that you install will not be able to adjust and get most of the wind noise out. The Jabras do a better job at that-Connectivity..... hahaha, In the gym I had issues when my phone was on the floor and I walked away for about 20 feet to get the wipes to wipe the chair and I had several machines in the way, pretty weird that I would loose connectivity, not cool-Then this really started to get on my nerves, while using the buds I started to get some weird noises, like some interference and after a few visits to YT, I found out the culprit, there is a very small membrane between the rubber attachment that goes into tour ear and the earbud. I have to remove them, clean them and very carefully reglue them in place. Problem solved for a few weeks.  Then the problem came back, I just remove them completely and the high pitch noise was gone-This is the nail in the coffin... I bought this in October 2022, in less that a year the left bud stop working, will not charge, cleaned the connections and nothing. Will not charge at all. Right bud continued working and charging normally. I used it for answering calls inside my car while driving in the military base I work. Its all hands free device inside the base. Unfortunately a few days ago it also stopped charging at all. Same problem as the left.So , my advice is do not buy, base on my experience and also others having the same issues on the internet.My Jabras are still going strong, not as good quality sound but they do the job.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.4,Sennheiser,"These were recommended to me by a friend and WOW. I have never used real noise-canceling headphones before and these make such a difference for school. The app is easy to use so I can just check to see if the noise-canceling feature is on or not, and turn it on/off easily. Very much worth the money if you are in noisy areas and are having trouble focusing. I did notice that they're best for humming ambient noise (machinery, laundry, fans). You definitely can still hear conversations around you, but they are much softer. One thing I'll do there is play white noise through the headphones with the noise canceling function on and that makes a huge difference.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.4,Sennheiser,"Haven't had any issues with the earbuds and their promised features.- Great fit in ear but bulky out of ear as you might expect so not great for sports.- sounds quality and customization is phenomenal- never have found battery to be a problem despite using frequently throughout multiple daysOnly feature I'd like, which is more a problem with my phone software, is an override to the default audio control in the sennheiser app. I generally find the lowest volume to still be loud and am currently using a volume equalizer at -15 dB.

Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.4,Sennheiser,"So I ordered this from a refurbisher in the hopes that, being of Sennheiser quality, they would meet the standard; they don’t. Since I’ve gotten these headphones, charging has been a downright pain in the backside. It will say it’s fully charged, but when you put them in your ear, it will tell you to charge. They will randomly not connect to both ears. I paid $200 for a useless product. Just buy direct. I’m not going to change this review, bc I’m not going to waste my time returning this product to a company that couldn’t get it right the first time. Atrocious",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.4,Sennheiser,"My hearing is fair…however,I’ve yet to find bluetooth buds loud enough for my liking. These are no exception…except these have features to compensate for that.The SMART CONTROL app, used in conjunction with the buds, is a vital tool in customizing my listening pleasure.The ‘tap’ features are numerous and each bud has its own settings, but it is customizable via SMART CONTROL. The ‘tap’ feature can be disabled entirely if need be.The touch is very sensitive, so much so that removing them or stowing away the buds to the case can easily change settings.Ergonomically they are nice. They twist into ear and stay put thanks to the custom tips and grommets.The initial connecting to phone was a little challenging. Without SMART CONTROL, I’m not sure it would even be possible.Over all, they are well thought-out in design, function and aesthetic.After a few months, I’m wishing I had not gotten RENEWED. It’s been quirky.The right hand bud will only charge with case open.It would be great if the charging case was connected to the app via bluetooth without having to remove buds, connect, then re-cradle the buds.The charging is confusing and not user friendly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.4,Sennheiser,"Most expensive set of earbuds I've owned, but the quality is out of this world for how small and light they are. Surprisingly deep bass available for these tiny buds after you mess with the equalizer settings and the built in noise cancelation and transparency are top notch. Battery life is pretty decent at about 4-5 hours of consistent play with noise canceling Active and works beautifully even in a loud automotive shop. Fits nice and snug in the ear if you follow how to put them in correctly in the manual and don't threaten to fall out.

Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds,Sennheiser,"I compared three earbuds in the same bracket:- Sony LinkBuds Fit- Bose QuietComfort Ultra- Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4Sony LinkBuds Fit🟊☆☆☆☆The tap controls are highly unreliable.

Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds,Sennheiser,This is my 2nd pair of Sennheiser earbuds and I will never buy any other brand. My last pair lasted a few years and that was with me using them practically at full blast every single day at work from 8-5 so the price is well worth it imo.My favorite thing about this brand is how customizable they are in both the fit and sound.My ears are an odd shape so it's hard for me to find earbuds that fit while also not being bulky and feeling like they're going to constantly fall out. The different tip and wing sizes they give are perfect for finding the right fit for any ear shape so they're comfortable enough to leave in all day.On the app you can also customize the sound you want based on your own desires or music style you listen to as well which is perfect for me. The transparency mode on these is also amazing so I can leave them in all day and just pause my music when I want to talk to someone and not deal with taking them out. And the battery life these things have is amazing enough for me to do just that!10/10 recommend these!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds,Sennheiser,"Let me start off with the pros.They sound great, and their app lets you personalize the audio however you wish. The fit is snug and the earbuds never fell out. They also last quite a while before needed to be recharged. And the quality LOOKS great.That’s about where the pros end, and the cons begin.First off they don’t sound much better than AirPod Pros, and yet they’re $50 more. Then comes the worst part - the reliability. I had these earbuds for roughly 2 months before they started having issues, specifically the right earbud. At first it would struggle connecting and wouldn’t charge at random point even though the left one was doing just fine. Then, roughly around the month and a half mark, the right earbud stopped working completely. Would not charge, play music, or even connect. It was completely dead. At around the 2 month mark, the left earbud followed suit. So I sent in the earbuds to one of their warranty claim centers, and it has been a downward spiral ever since.I’ve have dealt with customer support many times before, but this has to be the worst customer support I’ve ever dealt with. Here’s why:First off, finding their support number is not easy, as Sennheiser does not have a support center now that they are owned by Sonova. And to find their RMA website is even more difficult. Next, I never received any updates on the status—not even an email confirming receipt. I called shortly after the earbuds were expected to be delivered to check if they even received it and was told that they did but the facility is “offline” meaning they will only email you once the package has been sent back to you. On top of that, they informed me that it would take roughly 2 weeks (10 business days all in all) to get everything dealt with. I said okay and moved on.That wasn’t the end of it.Sennheiser finally emails me to ask me for proof of purchase, to which I quickly reply with a screenshot of the purchase details from Amazon. In the email it said that if I did not reply within 5 business days of the email, they would send back the earbuds. Now, 4 business days later, I receive an email saying that the receipt did not the proof of purchase details necessary, giving me less than a day to deal with this.Last thing to note, I did some research when I started seeing these issues and it appears that the malfunction I had with my earbuds has been around for a few years now, ever since their 2nd series of these earbuds. It’s clear that the issue hasn’t been fixed by Sennheiser since then.Overall, I would not recommend these by a long shot. I always heard everyone praise Sennheiser’s headphones and earbuds so I thought it would be a smarter buy than AirPod Pros.

Sennheiser Consumer Audio CX Plus True Wireless Special Edition,Sennheiser,"TL:DR - Best sub-$200 earbuds with great noise canceling, superb sound and better than Samsung Galaxy Buds in every way.I recently had my Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus (purchased fall 2020) finally stop working (thank you, planned obsolescence). In researching for new buds, I began looking outside Samsung as I've always wanted to try the Sony buds, and the new Galaxy Buds Pro do not stay in my ears (I tried my sister's pair). Some YouTube reviews pitted the Sony buds against these, and I knew Senheiser to be a reputable audio brand so I decided to give them a shot. Also, the Sony's were almost 2 years old and hard to find, and the new version was over $200.First, noise canceling: I've never used a pair of noise canceling anything before, so take what I'm about to say with a few grains of salt. My test was to try it in my living room with a TV on normal listening volume, furnace running (mine is fairly noisy, enough to need to crank the TV up a few notches), and normal conversation happening in the kitchen about 15 feet away with no walls separating it. I couldn't hear the furnace at all, the conversation was like a whisper, and the TV was only slightly audible. It was like having it on level 3 or 4 above mute which would be completely inaudible with the furnace running. Now, it did not filter out any harsh or loud noises, like a dog barking or dishes clattering, but the passive isolation is good enough that it wasn't a big deal.Second, sound: Senheiser has a good reputation for a reason. I'm a basshead who routinely listens to hip hop, heavy metal and some electronic music. As a former music major in college and amateur DJ, I also love to fiddle around with equalizers to find the perfect sound for me. Straight out the box with no EQ enabled, the bass is pretty flat and that worried me. But the mids and highs were excellent and FAR better than the Samsungs I used to have. Once I fired up my EQ app (Poweramp EQ on Android), my worries were gone. I was able to tune it so that the bass was like having 2 10-inch subwoofers in my ears without drowning out the rest of the music. I listen to a lot of podcasts as well, and they are excellent for voice-only content as well.Call Quality: Every time I've had a phone call on these buds, no one has complained that I was inaudible in any way.Connection and Range: I can make it further and through more walls/obstructions than my old Galaxy Buds. They perform excellent, and only cut out after about 50 direct feet and 2 home floors comprised of wood, carpet and finally a brick wall on my back patio. The available APTx bluetooth codec makes latency nonexistent.Fit: I mentioned that the new Galaxy Buds didn't fit me, and that was due to me having a larger outer ear shape. The Buds Plus I had used a wing tip that held it in place, but the new ones do not have that. I used the standard medium-sized tips that were installed on the Senheiser buds, and due to their square shape and how deep they go into my ear canal, they fit like a glove. I can headbang to Orbit Culture until I'm dizzy and sweaty and they won't budge.Verdict: you won't find a better pair of buds sub-$200 IMO, and if you don't find the sound to your liking, give a 3rd party EQ app (like Poweramp) a try before returning them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio CX Plus True Wireless Special Edition,Sennheiser,"Loved the 'Black Friday' pricing on these, but love the fit, comfort, & sound quality even more!  I got the Special Edition version of these ear buds.Had been using Galaxy Pro buds that I bought along with my Galaxy phone.  They were decent, but uncomfortable for long periods, & sound quality was just not what I expected from an earbud that expensive & I wish I had realized it soon enough to return the Galaxy Pro buds :(These CX Plus buds on the other hand, are well worth the MSRP!So far only charged them once when I first got them & I have yet to run down the battery.  Longest I've used them continuously at one time so far is about 6.5 hours & usually it's just a couple hours here, a couple hours there.  Most of the time I have the volume pretty low, at about 25% - 30%.  But I do put them back in the case between uses.  I would estimate a total usage so far of about 20 - 22 hours.The only cons for me are:>  the ""Transparent Hearing mode"" which seems to amplify external sounds just a little bit too much.... if it were scaled back about 10% - 15% I think it might be perfect.> noise cancellation which seems to add background noise that is noticeable in between songs.>  tap controls can be tricky, sometimes when I try to skip to next song, it will instead pause & unpause, and occasionally just pause.EDIT Sept. 17, 2023:  Been using these a LOT lately, I'm hearing stuff in music that I've never heard before , songs I've listened to thousands of times on various systems.  Things like whispered words in the background of some songs, acoustic guitar fills in some songs, noise from guitar picks, short 1 or 2 second guitar overlays on the Right track of a Hendrix song, even potentially unwanted outside sounds captured during recordings, or maybe even those were there deliberately???  I cannot believe all the stuff I've missed in songs over the years, but glad I finally have speakers/headphones good enough that I can finally hear them.Battery life has proven to be phenomenal, possibly because I have no need to play these loudly to block out external sounds like my table saw & dust collector, or when I want to ignore the world around me.  Although I don't track it completely, it seems like battery life for me may surpass the 24 hour mark.  I have done a 5 day stretch without charging and without the ear buds dying,  2 days were 6-8 hours of listening, the rest were 2-4 hours, so I would guess somewhere between 20 & 26 hours.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio CX Plus True Wireless Special Edition,Sennheiser,"I bought this product 6 months ago and use it about once a week for a few hours on average. The last time I used it the left side was way more quiet then the right side. I know a lot of the times its because there are debris clogging up the earbud but i actually cleaned it up and the problem persisted. I am surprised and disapointed because sennheiser is usually a good company so there is a chance I just got a bad product. But the thing is, trying to get warrenty service seems to be a nightmare. I need to fill out a form and they request a bunch of info that i do not have such as shipping account number, invoice account number, and purchase order/reference. It states on the site that i must contact support fot the numbers if i do not have it, but there is no way to get in touch with any support reps. The customer service phone number leads to a dial tone and there is no live chat to be found anywhere on their website even though the support page mentions a live chat. Even searching ""sennheiser live chat"" on google leads to the support page with no live chat. Defintely one of the worst hardware experiences I've ever had so far. The product itself is fine other then it not working. The sound quality is above average and the ANC is decent. The case feels super cheap, the lid feels like it will snap off at any moment. No matter how good the product is, I cannot justify giving it more then 0 stars for something I paid $160 for and only lasting 6 months with low usage.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser ACCENTUM True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"If you’ve always had issues with sennheiser’s fit on your ears with their smaller earbuds, this is the one for you.These are not for working out, for those momentum sport would be the equivalent.They sound almost perfect with the exception of not hitting the highest highs, and the majority of “complaints” are probably because they somehow made it so these won’t hurt your hearing, so the gain is kept in check by its sound processing, which is a bonus honestly.They feature decent noise cancelling and some IPX protection for the buds only for light rain for your commute.Lastly, I think my favorite feature is multipoint connection so you don’t have to manage what it’s connected to though you still can manage that too through the app. They also have a wear sensor to pause if you take them out (can be disabled).The only issue for some might be that the touch controls have a very specific activation point which you’ll either love or hate based on how much you have to take them off and how often (it makes it easier to take them off without activating them).Check the other specs to see if it meets your needs, I don’t use buds to take calls (that’s a terrible use case for any bud), and for that I’d recommend something with a boom mic.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser ACCENTUM True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"Other than being a lil heavy and not fitting exactly, but I never have found any that do, these things get really loud, sync easily, and provide sounds that I don’t hear otherwise. Sound is top notch typical Sennheiser for me. Just wish the buggers would stay in my ears better! The mic is alright, although I dont use it much. It does not sound as good as the boom mic on a call center type Plantronics headset, but it’s usable.  Bettery life is good. I can easily listen to a whole Purple Rain Soundtrack, then Ritual de lo Habitual, and a few hours of YouTubes, then accidentally let it run out by taking them out and not putting them away properly or if I do, there’s still room for a little more Sneaker Pimps, UGK, or Nicolas Jaar before Damn!

Sennheiser ACCENTUM True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"I got these after my 3rd set of Bose gave out after a year. It’s sad that no matter how much I spend, or how little, ear buds seem to only last 1 single year. But I digress. I decided to try the Sennheiser ACCENTUM. They fit great, sounded great with a noice canceling capability that was even above the Bose. A win win! Then, a week later…I began my day as usual and put in the earbuds. Something wasn’t right. The right side wasn’t working. Hmm ok I must’ve seated it wrong to charge. I looked at the app and sure enough it seemed to be the case. Odd, but oh well. Then the next week, same thing except this time everything seemed ok but after wearing them for 5 minutes the built in voice told me to charge the headset. This has happened on an irregular basis but no less than 3-4 times a month. I had reached out to sennheiser, but to no avail. Customer service must not be a priority with them. I haven’t bothered simply returning them because I have an extra headset I can use while I reseat the buds and charge them for an hour. Call me lazy - I would.The other shortcoming I have to list is the shorter battery life, at least compared to the Bose quietcomfort. It doesn’t even last a full six hours. The Bose lasted over 8.In the long run, I wear them for the noise canceling. The sound is good but I only listen to podcasts and audiobooks so there’s that.The app is ok and does have a lot more features than the Bose does. But that’s not really a selling point for me.In conclusion, I wouldn’t really recommend these until the charging issues are fixed. From what I’ve read in a few places, I certainly am not alone in having this issue.Why can’t there be a company that can produce something worthwhile. It’s not like the big names don’t have the experience. They just all want to make things substandard and over hype them. As if we are made of money. *sigh*",2.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser ACCENTUM True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"TLDR: My least favorite Sennheiser earbuds.I've been using Sennheiser earbuds for at least eight years now, and I've tried their full line by now. I'm not an audiophile, I'm only listening to audiobooks and taking calls, so please take my suggestions about audio quality with a grain of salt.I usually buy two of whatever earbuds at a time, and they get swapped when one runs out of battery, so technically this review is for a pair of these.1. Audio quality. Accentum seems fine, but IMO the CX series sounds better.  Mic quality seems good, but I've never had problems there with anything Sennheiser.2. The ANC and passthrough are absolutely terrible on Accentum. To the point where I can't easily tell if it's even on. It's not a feature I absolutely need, but do not count ANC as a major benefit on Accentum.3. Totally unscientific, but the battery life seems bad on Accentum compared to CX. It's possible this is because I have ANC on and don't notice it, but the practical effect is I hear ""battery low"" more times a day.4. The case is just asinine. It's lovely that it charges wireless, but why would you put the usb plug facing the same direction the thing opens? Also, it's not deep enough to reliably fit foam eartips -- the foam tends to push them up just enough over time that it triggers a new ""connecting device"".5. I got 3 months usage with one set before one of the buds cut out. idk what the warranty situation is, but I have some CX survivors that are over 2 years old. Yes, they're tiny delicate devices that I wear like 16 hours a day, but 3 months is too short.The only plus I'll give Accentum over CX is that it is nice having a slimmer profile on the earbuds. Personally I'd take better battery life over a slimmer profile, but that's up to you.After a short stint with Accentum, I'm switching back to CX.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser ACCENTUM Open Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"These fit just like the older, discontinued Apple AirPods!  I have been on a search for something similar.  I don’t like the fit of the new ones.  If you liked the old fit, these are amazing.  The sound quality is excellent & I like that I can still hear surroundings.  They kept disconnecting, but I found online that if you triple tap the left earbud, auto pause will turn off. Now they’re perfect.  I hope they don’t discontinue these too.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sennheiser ACCENTUM Open Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"After the left side of my previous earbuds died, I needed a new pair and thought to go with Sennheiser since I have used their HD6XX at my PC for years now with no issues.Other than the one main issue mentioned in the title, these are solid. Fit is okay, I'm not a huge fan but they fit fine and aren't overly uncomfortable. Sound quality is pretty solid, though hampered by the open design (most low frequencies are inaudible). Battery life has also not been an issue at all, I have not had an earbud die while listening yet, even over some pretty long car rides.However, there is one absolutely massive, glaring issue that made me return these and give the 1 star rating. They keep randomly stopping. Sitting still at work, playing drums or guitar, walking at a normal pace on the street, it doesn't matter. During my 30 minute walk to work this morning, they randomly stopped playing 6 times. I think that it's a mix of two issues, the ""removal detection"" that paused music if you take the headphones out seems poorly tuned, and I believe the way these sit in my ears places the stems in the tops of my facial hair, and they are randomly pausing due to detecting those touches.For the price of these, I would most certainly hope for a better product, especially since there are really only 1-2 design flaws for an otherwise solid product. With better configuration these might still be usable, but they aren't for me",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser ACCENTUM Open Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"Wanted to love them, but ended up returning them due to not being comfortable in my ears.Sound quality was fine, but I'm also not very picky or looking for the best sound so I'm easily appeased.Fit felt good at first, but after a couple of hours, I could definitely tell that they were causing a bit of soreness. Tried them again the next day but the soreness just continued and didn't disappear with use. Paaaaaain.Very lightweight and impressively so, but with how light they were, I kept having the notion that they were going to fall out and a few times that I didn't adjust, they did fall out. The falling out could be due to my ears just not being a good fit for these earbuds. They might work well for someone else, just not me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sennheiser ACCENTUM Open Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"These seem like an un-polished product. The sound is good, bass is good. But it has a lot of deal breakers that come down to product design.First of all, it's not one size fits all. I have a fairly generic ear size, and any time i bend down slightly or even so much as look down, they begin to fall out.Second of all,  the case has an extremely loose lid. I can close it by tilting forward, there's 0 resistance.If a loose fit and loose lid is ok with you, these are excellent for their price.There's no app, connecting them was super simple, and the build quality is good.When they release a more polished version that fixes the obvious issues, I'll be happy to purchase it and hopefully give a better review as I have a medical reason to use headphones that don't have any silicon.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Sennheiser Momentum Sport,Sennheiser,"Fits well with my large ears (usually need a large or XL silicone tip to make isolation work).They are decently flush, do not sick out far.  I appreciate the custom tip and wing sizes.  I have not tried the Polar Watch Health Features that sync with this, but I can tell you that it is great to see Realtime heart rate and body temp (seems accurate when comparing with my other sensors) in the Sennheiser App.Because they fit snug, I do get a bit of ear fatigue but these are the only earbuds that stay in my ear with sports, eating, or moving.Noice Canceling is great, worked well on a pain.  ""Wind mode"" seems to work like transparency mode on other earbuds.  The sound... better than Pixel Buds Pro 2, possibly better than Bose... Nice highs and good balanced lows (not overpowering bass but there is an emphasis on base).  First pair of earbuds to have the treble be sharp and precise, I love the sound.A bit expensive at full cost but if you can get on a deal, I would recommend them if you need noise canceling earbuds and have hard to fit (always fall out) type of ears.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Momentum Sport,Sennheiser,"Three gripes: (1) touch controls, (2) noise cancelling and (3) comfort.(1) Touch controls don’t work properly, cannot be turned off, and are unintuitive.1/3 of the time they don’t respond to touch; they also trigger when they’re adjusted for fit, or even when chewing food or encountering a bump while driving.The app provides VERY limited ability to customize or disable touch controls, so I often hang up calls when simply trying to adjust them in my ear, and I cannot disable this.There are too many controls they trigger (e.g. hanging up, volume up, volume down, anti wind) via unintuitive touch patterns (I’m a software engineer in my 20s so I’m no stranger to technology).(2) Noise cancelling is sub par, particularly because it breaks and clicks very consistently when (a) riding over bumps in the road and (b) chewing food.(3) Fit/comfort is OK at best and it gets itchy when left in for long.Sound quality is fine and it stays in the ear well, but the touch controls and noise cancelling are so bad I cannot rate it above 1 star.I do not recommend this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Momentum Sport,Sennheiser,Great sound. Stays in ear. Good price.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Momentum Sport,Sennheiser,"Sound quality is good anc works as expected.Thought there's very little control over the volume level especially on the low end. It goes from mute to comfortable listening volume. If I want to listen to something at a low volume I can only get the volume low enough by using developer options so the Bluetooth volume is it's not linked to the internal volume of the earbuds. For this I have to disable absolute volume and restart my phone. This works and I get the control of the volume on the low end but lose it on the high end. The maximum volume is now lower. So if I want to listen at a higher volume, I have to change the setting again and restart my phone. I tried using an app that changed the number of steps the phone volume has to 100. So one step is 1%. I'd still like to be able to get it quieter then it's is at 1% without having to use developer options to turn on and off the absolute volume. I've never had this issue with any other headphone, earbud, wireless speaker, or car audio. I tried using the EQ in the app to accomplish the same thing and of course it had no effect. The issue is that the sliders for the EQ in their app are relative to other slider positions. So if all of the sliders are brought down to -6b it sounds the same as if they're all in the center. I was able to use Androids EQ to bring the volume down a little bit lower.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have never used real noise-canceling headphones before and these make such a difference for school. The app is easy to use so I can just check to see if the noise-canceling feature is on or not, and turn it on/off easily. Very much worth the money if you are in noisy areas and are having trouble focusing. I did notice that they're best for humming ambient noise (machinery, laundry, fans). You definitely can still hear conversations around you, but they are much softer.

Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Smart Earbuds,Sennheiser,"My hearing is fair…however,I’ve yet to find bluetooth buds loud enough for my liking. These are no exception…except these have features to compensate for that.The SMART CONTROL app, used in conjunction with the buds, is a vital tool in customizing my listening pleasure.The ‘tap’ features are numerous and each bud has its own settings, but it is customizable via SMART CONTROL. The ‘tap’ feature can be disabled entirely if need be.The touch is very sensitive, so much so that removing them or stowing away the buds to the case can easily change settings.Ergonomically they are nice. They twist into ear and stay put thanks to the custom tips and grommets.The initial connecting to phone was a little challenging. Without SMART CONTROL, I’m not sure it would even be possible.Over all, they are well thought-out in design, function and aesthetic.After a few months, I’m wishing I had not gotten RENEWED. It’s been quirky.The right hand bud will only charge with case open.It would be great if the charging case was connected to the app via bluetooth without having to remove buds, connect, then re-cradle the buds.The charging is confusing and not user friendly.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Sennheiser Consumer Audio CX True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"I’ve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I’d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The “Quick setup guide” was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone.  Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I’m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone’s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds.  I can’t comment on failed bub issues yet, it’s too early, so we’ll see.I didn’t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio CX True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn’t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn’t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I’ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don’t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth  however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only “issue” I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It’s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I’ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I’ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it’s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It’s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it’s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds -Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones for Music,Sennheiser,"So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The ""Bass Boost"" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean.

Sennheiser Consumer Audio MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds -Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones for Music,Sennheiser,"I never do reviews of products, but in this case I will because of the price of this product. In the past I bought  cheap earbuds. Mostly because I use them for the gym. In the car I usually connect my phone to the radio to listen to the music, so no reason to use while driving. The most expensive brand that I bought was the DR Dre powerbeats. Decent sound at a decent price and great for the gym because they have the hook and will not fall off when exercising. But almost immediately they started having issues with charging. So then I got the Jabra elite 75T. I still have them, no issues with charging, great Bluetooth connectivity, decent active noise cancellation and decent sound. Im happy with them and still work good for the price. I paid $179 in amazon. But I wanted more regarding the sound quality so I started looking at reviews on You Tube and found the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3. Great sound, decent ANC, decent battery and connectivity. I compared them to Sony, Bose and Jabra and decided on the Sennheiser. Well, here we go....-Sound is amazing, very happy with them- Battery is as expected, I imagine base on the size of the buds, and sound they are putting out.- Wind noise will affect this buds, even with the software that you install will not be able to adjust and get most of the wind noise out. The Jabras do a better job at that-Connectivity..... hahaha, In the gym I had issues when my phone was on the floor and I walked away for about 20 feet to get the wipes to wipe the chair and I had several machines in the way, pretty weird that I would loose connectivity, not cool-Then this really started to get on my nerves, while using the buds I started to get some weird noises, like some interference and after a few visits to YT, I found out the culprit, there is a very small membrane between the rubber attachment that goes into tour ear and the earbud. I have to remove them, clean them and very carefully reglue them in place. Problem solved for a few weeks.  Then the problem came back, I just remove them completely and the high pitch noise was gone-This is the nail in the coffin... I bought this in October 2022, in less that a year the left bud stop working, will not charge, cleaned the connections and nothing. Will not charge at all. Right bud continued working and charging normally. I used it for answering calls inside my car while driving in the military base I work. Its all hands free device inside the base. Unfortunately a few days ago it also stopped charging at all. Same problem as the left.So , my advice is do not buy, base on my experience and also others having the same issues on the internet.My Jabras are still going strong, not as good quality sound but they do the job.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sennheiser Consumer Audio MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones for Music and Call with ANC,Sennheiser,"So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The ""Bass Boost"" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean. You can eq the treble back in, but someone like Sennheiser should have a better solution than that with their software.The bluetooth range is not great with my Samsung S21 Ultra. With my old Jaybird Tarah pro's which are several years old, I could leave my phone in the garage and walk to the back yard and stay connected. with these I barely get to the end of driveway b4 they start cutting out (maybe 30ish feet or so).

Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones,Sennheiser,"The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are great wireless headphones. I find them to be really easy to use and they sound great. At lower volumes, the sound is v-shaped. But if you bump up the volume a few clicks everything is pretty much even-sounding and not v-shaped. The bass is great, better than my HD600s. The mid-range is lush and full and the treble is just enough to not be harsh. I was using a desk-based system with a topping 7-series dac and amp and the Sennheiser HD600s for a while. The momentum 4 give me portability which is a plus when doing house chores. The touch panel on the right earcup doesn't work that well so I turned it off in the app. The app you need to do firmware updates and control the features is called ""Sennheiser Smart Control Plus"" and it's available for android and iOS. A nice feature is that the headphones turn off when removed from the head, saving battery life. They sound pretty astounding and in my opinion don't even need EQ although it's available in the phone app. They fit a little snug but comfort is top notch. The clamping pressure is not bad and I don't even need noise cancellation since the seal is so good. The price on amazon is great for these when they're roughly half off retail.

Sennheiser Consumer Audio Sport True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"These are exactly what I wanted - a high quality ear bud set that will be my main workout pair (including running or mountain biking, so they need to be extra secure), but that I could also use in place of my ""casual listening"" pair in a pinch if the sound was good enough. I feel like a lot of these reviews don't understand the basics of using ear hooks, or the necessity of using the app to flip between the two sound modes depending on the open ear tips or closed ear tips.If you're going to use the open ear tips (which have a couple tiny holes to let in some outside sound - not much, but enough that you can have a conversation without removing them), the Sennheiser app adjusts the base profile to make everything sound great. Same with using the closed tips.  I tried using the ""wrong"" settings on purpose to see the difference and wow, it changes the sound signature quite a bit to account for the open/closed earspace.  And they nailed it in keeping it sounding consistent depending on which ears tips you're using.PS - You also need to do the firmware update in the app.  Some nitpicks have long been addressed, it seems.Anyhow, I FINALLY found my workout pair.  It's been years of searching.  Definitely better sound than my Beats Fit Pro (very solid performer and almost perfect, but not great enough to justify the extra $100) or Earfun air pro 2s (which sounded awesome and are a great value, but I had to put an aftermarket silicone ear wing attachment on them every time i used them to keep them in, but which wouldnt fit back in the charging case if the tip was still attached).  These Sennheisers sound better than those two.  These sound comparable to the Jabra Elite 85T and might actually have more crisp bass response.

Since the repair, theyve been working great (2+years). I've used these things for 3900+ hours at this point and they are still like new in every way.It's rare nowadays to buy something like this and have them work so well for so long.

Sennheiser Consumer Audio Sport True Wireless Earbuds,Sennheiser,"I have only used the earbuds about a dozen or so times.  Mostly for jogging which is 15-20 minutes.  A couple of times for bicycling around for a few hours.THE GOODThey have an IP rating for water resistance.  Great for working out and resisting a few rain drops.  The sound quality is pretty good, especially the bass.  They are comfortable in the ear for a somewhat extended period of time, but not all day.  Eventually my ear gets tired and hurts from them.  So under 2 hours of use is ideal.  Your mileage may vary.THE MEDIOCREThese are not extremely loud when using outside in a busy street, such as walking, jogging, bicycling, or any outdoor activity with heavy vehicle traffic around.  I'm sure they are perfect for hiking, skiing/snowboarding, mountain biking, or the like, where there is some quiet.THE BADAfter a few uses, the left earbud has begun lowering the volume by itself after a few minutes of use, becoming inaudible, making only the right earbud produce proper sound level based on the volume level of the connected device.  I can barely hear the left earbud.  I have to go through the ritual of disabling all Bluetooth devices, manually restoring the earbuds to factory settings, re-paring them with each other, using the Sennheiser app to also perform a factory reset, putting them into the charging case to turn off, take them out of the charging case, reconnect them to device, sacrificing various animals and praying to some undead god beyond the cosmos, just get both earbuds working properly.  And it only lasts for a few minutes, maybe 10-15, before it does it again.  This is garbage.MY RECOMMENDATIONIf you have some money that wants to be liberated from your possession, buy these earbuds, use them a few times, and cherish each of those times it works.  Then subsequently smash them with a hammer, because they will be more useful as broken pieces of plastic and electronic innards, then keeping it around, frustrating you to no end as to why the damn earbuds don't work properly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

They sound FANTASTIC (I am a bit of an audiophile and sound quality is very important to me).  These earbuds have the very best sound I have found for any earbuds.  The fit in my ear is fantastic.  The software and pairing process is super easy.  My only criticism is occasionally one of the earbuds will lose it's Bluetooth connection - it only happens occasionally, but it is annoying.  It's easily fixed by touching the earbud once or twice to turn them on and off - the connection is then reestablished.  Overall, I love them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"So I can say this, the dime evo has great battery life for the earbuds and the holder of the earbuds.Noise cancellation is really good but may attenuate some of the high frequencies, but that could be just my ears.Tap three times on the left earbud and you hear sound around you.Tap again three times and you’re back into noise cancellation.I have to say that I’ve been very impressed by this model in all aspects.They fit my ears very well and for someone who has very small ear canals I’m very impressed and how well they fit.I could be jogging or in a full run, and I have no worries of them ever falling out! so if you’re looking for some earbuds that have really good clarity very easy to control your volume on them. Good mic, quality when you’re talking to someone on the phone battery life noise, cancellation I’m telling you these are really a nice set of earbuds to get in for the price you really can’t go wrong.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,Amazing quality for an amazing price just as good as my old bose that i had before these. My bose lasted me a good like 10 or more years they still work but are falling apart so I got these I can confidently say these are just as good if not better than my bose very comfortable in my small ears and the sound quality is top tier!! They also have better noise cancelation than my bose and no sound leaking out for other people to hear. I like how portable these are with a clip on the case so I can clip them on my jeans instead of putting them in my pocket which was my issue with my bose because the case is really big. They were really easy to connect through the app I was also able to connect them without the app but I personally like using the app because it tells you information like the batery of each earbud and lets you cusomize the sound along with other things.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"Pros and cons.These things stay charged forever, and their case recharges them quickly. I can go a week without charging the case, though I usually only use one at a time in public.The sound is amazing and they fit in my ears comfortably.The only negative is that the outside plastic piece fell off of one of the buds within a few days. I'm careful with them and don't remember dropping it or anything. It doesn't affect the function, just makes the button harder to push. Small negative that I just wanted to mention.All in all, they are incredible earbuds when considering the price,volume, sound quality, and especially battery life. The clip is also very handy",4.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"These earbuds are great. They connect seamlessly and can even connect to two devices at once, which is great for me when I am working on both my laptop and work PC. They don't have active voice canceling, but their sound blocking is so good that people have had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention even when I'm only listening at low volumes. Sound quality is also good! Battery life is also decent and can last me a full day wearing them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"These are the best earbuds I’ve ever had. Period. As someone who has gotten through SEVERAL pairs of earbuds over the years, no company has provided the best value like Skullcandy does on the dime products. I’ve had the dime 3 for over a year now as my go to and I upgraded to the dime evo today, the difference in features is wild considering this pair is $60, only a few dollars more than the dime 3. They sound great and neutral, work seamlessly with 2 devices at once, and thy have the app to control the equalizer. I honestly can’t ask for more and I thank Skullcandy for creating an amazing product for an insanely great price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,these headphones are awesome for the price. i accidentally dropped of of the earbuds in the toilet i was worried that it would break it or make the audio sound worse. but after i managed to get it out and clean it off it sounded perfectly fine and it didnt mess with the charging process either. they are in fact noise canceling if you have both earbuds in with a high enough volume. sound quality is crisp you can hear every instrument and beat. very good headphones if on a budget,5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Dime Evo Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"I love these earbuds, i use them for work and they fit well without falling out as i move alot and the charge lasts well over 10 hours. Also the case is super handy. Definitely worth more than what they cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Skullcandy Method 360 ANC Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"I'd used many models in the Samsung Galaxy Buds lineup, the last being a couple pairs of the Buds 2 Pros. While I liked the Samung earbuds, I put about 30 hours of use on the headphones weekly and they never held up for more than 3 or 4 months. One earbud (most always the right) would lose volume and quality until it failed to produce listenable sound at all. I'd use the Samung warranty, then the extended warranty that I'd purchased, then buy another pair and start over. Which each new model I'd hoped Samung had fixed the durability issues, but they never had, so I finally decided to try something new.In comes the Method 360s. I've been using these guys for nearly a year now and they haven't lost sound volume or quality in the slightest. While the higher frequencies might not be quite as clear or expansive as the Buds 2 Pros, I think they sound great for the price and I love their punchy bass. The volume on the highest setting also seems to be a little louder than other earbuds that I've had, which can be nice.I'm not impressed with their ANC. I hardly notice it compared to my Bose over-the-ear headphones, but it's not an issue when paired with their passive noise cancelation and I wasn't impressed with the Buds 2 Pros ANC, either. I have some connectivity issues here and there where one bud won't pair with my Samsung phone out of the case. I'll put the earbud back in the case and take it out again and then I'm good to go. I've never lost Bluetooth connection once paired.All in all, I think these are good buds for a good priceI finally decided to try something else and that's where these",5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,I love the sound of it. Lots of bass!!! Great noise cancelling. I’ve been struggling to find a phone that is comfortable enough and don’t fall of my ear during activities. This earphone sits very well on the ears and stay stuck until you want them loose. Definitely this thing is a masterpiece for the price and potential competitors.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,So these are like Bose QC earbuds II same design and feel to them so if you ever seen or used them that's how it out of the case. The case is a bit weird it's a long case that slides up and down and each side is marked with R and L to tell which side each earbud goes to. The positives are the sound is amazing and anc is very good I use them at 40 to 50 percent volume and it blocks out a lot of sound. The charging is pretty fast about 20 minutes and I get an hour and some minutes back to listen to them again and these are very comfortable and come with 3 size options and are able it a good amount of colors to purchase and it has an option to connect to your email for fast connection to any device that uses that certain email which is cool. Another great thing is single earbud can use anc option which I use daily since my job only allows one earbud in and works great.Negatives are small in my opinion one is the battery life is a lie with anc on it lasts about 6.5 hours not 9 like it was registered on the list and I know because I usually work long shifts and about half way I have to charge up and second issue is with both earbuds in is stuttering this comes up at small intervals and it's annoying hearing skips in songs or video if you're in crowded place or on a walk and I think it has to do with Bluetooth connection not going through multiple channels and skull app is useless so I tried to fix by using their methods to attempt a fix and it still happens so I think it's a bad Bluetooth connection and I looked online and seen other people complaining about this issue.So in the end if skullcandy could fix the connection stutters and their own app to get this small issue to go away I would rate them 5 out 5 but it ain't it gots some issues like I mentioned above but it's like a good alternative to a cheaper version of the Bose QC earbuds II,4.0 out of 5 stars
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC Wireless Earbuds,Skullcandy,"Sounds quality is great, fitment is great, and connectivity for me was a breeze with no drops at all.I hit the gym with these 3 days in a row now with zero issues. The fitment is snug and no need for readjustment during my 1.5 hour gym sessions which also includes running the treadmill. The earbud silicone pieces do not get stuck in my ears or slide off the earbuds at all. I'm assuming people who complain about the silicone coming off/undone must be user error or improperly installed.Bluetooth connection for me has been solid on my Google Pixel 7 Pro, including my friends iPhone 16 Pro Max. I did download the Skullcandy IQ app which prompt me for an update that I did. No connectivity issues at all so far.My battery life is currently at 97% with 3 days worth of gym use at about 1.5hrs per day at medium to medium/high volume with ANC turned off (from fully charged).The case is on the bulky side, however, it's easy to use. People complaining about how difficult/annoying it is to put the earbuds back in the case are simple minded. All you have to do is literally look at the orientation of the ear buds upon removal and put them back the exact same way. I guess people need something to complain about.I'd absolutely recommend these earbuds, especially over the air pods, beats, or SoundCloud. Wait for a sale or buy them used like I did.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless in-Ear Bluetooth Earbud Headphones with up to 22-Hour Battery,Sony,"Comfortable and easy to wear for hours without my ears hurting. Sony has nailed the design for long term wear for all wireless Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Does not fall out easily and fits ergonomically. I am confident I won't lose these easily. I love the large button pressed to control music, calls, etc. I enjoy that it's not touch-sensitive like Samsung earbuds, which have been falsely set off by my hair or beanie. My complaints: these buttons are not programmable: what type of madman want people to press 4 times to change volume up/down? I would also love a ""Find Earbuds"" function if they are connected to a device, but the owner isn't sure where they placed them.Noise cancellation is non-existent, but you have ambient sound (listen to your surroundings) if you wish to have both music and some situational awareness. The case is *slim*, much slimmer than Sony's previous cases. Sound is very decent for the price. With the latest iterations of Bluetooth, these earbuds can be connected to 2 devices at a time, but they cannot play sound from both sources at once. All in all, I recommend if you need a decent and comfortable pair of earbuds with which to listen to music and audio for hours. Sometimes, I use them for more than 6 hours and I'm surprised the battery still goes strong. I've been using them for 5 months now, and like other Sony earbuds I've owned in the past, I expect their longevity to last years.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless in-Ear Bluetooth Earbud Headphones with up to 22-Hour Battery,Sony,"1) The sound of the WF-C510 is really good right out of the box without EQ. I listen to a lot of music, various genres, and everything is balanced and in control. Punchy bass, treble that's crisp and doesn't make my ears bleed, and decent mids. I definitely trust Sony when it comes to audio products.2) Fit and comfort are amazing! I can leave these in all day. No joke, after 5+ hours of use, I feel zero discomfort. Not only are these earbuds the most comfortable earbuds of all time, but getting a good in-ear seal is effortless. Just set them and forget them, zero hassle. Just to note, there's no ANC but I don't mind; I use these at home where it's already quiet. Further, there's a feature called Ambient Sound Control, kind of the opposite of ANC, that lets outside noises in (press button on left earbud). Obviously, the volume has to be pretty low for this feature to be useful.3) I rarely ever use playback controls on a pair of earbuds, as I just use my phone for that stuff. However, the physical buttons on the WF-C510 work like they should and it's always nice to have actual buttons over touch controls, mainly because there's less chance for accidental inputs, a common occurrence on my other earbuds.4) The battery life seems to jive with Sony's claims of 11 hours in the buds and another 11 in the case. I'm getting a 50% battery level after 5+ hours at a volume level above half with the ""Sony Sound Connect"" app installed on my phone. I'll admit, the 11 hour battery claim was the #1 factor for my purchase.5) The app gives you a ton of stuff to play around with. There's a bunch of EQs, 360 audio (more app downloads and payment required, I think), information regarding battery levels, and more.6) A couple of oddities: The charging case confuses me. Does the orange light turn off when charging is complete or does it stay lit? I've experienced both scenarios and both times the app said the earbuds and case were at 100%. The instruction manual was no help. Also, for some reason I had to re-pair the earbuds to my phone's Bluetooth after shutting it off, which was super annoying. I was testing to see if an older device (without the app) would pair, so to avoid interference I turned off my phone's Bluetooth. The older device paired with the earbuds just fine without the app, so it isn't required. I plan on deleting it; it's probably a major battery hog anyway.7) Minor issues aside, the Sony WF-C510 delivers premium comfort and pleasing sound. and they're super affordable. Get yours today! lolUpdate 3/25 -- Checking in to mention that the orange charging light on the case does in fact shut off to indicate that charging is complete and I'm still very happy with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless in-Ear Bluetooth Earbud Headphones with up to 22-Hour Battery,Sony,"My experience with the Sony (WF-C510) has been great. They are not too bulky to carry around.  Their transparency mode is solid. They don’t have a noise canceling mode but just wearing the buds block out a good amount of noise. They are comfortable and fit right in and have never fell out on their own. I haven’t had any issues with the mic during phone calls; I am told I sound clear.I use them at work. They pair with my computer and my phone at the same time. That’s one of the main reasons I bought these. The audio quality is really good. Way better than my AirPod pro 1st gen. I like the EQ settings on the app. Battery life is never a worry for me. I can go a few days with a full charge.Only a few complaints. One is the app should have a setting where it lets you customize what the taps do.Second is when on call, it goes into transparency mode which I don’t like but not a deal breaker.Overall for the price I paid I would recommend these. I will update my review if I have any issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I’d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn’t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"I have tested many earbuds and for the price I’d consider these better than any wireless earbuds on the market like AirPods, skullcandy, and Bose. I’ve only had to charge them twice in 4 months. They sound really good with the adaptive noise cancellation and custom equalizer. The microphone quality could be better, but the value for price is INSANE. The different sized tips fit any ear and the functionality it overall the best I’ve seen.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi “in ear monitor” quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won’t likely notice any difference.So, let’s start with a “strong average” rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what’s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear “taps” for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN’T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn’t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to “force” ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don’t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don’t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don’t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don’t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it’s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"The Soundcore P30i by Anker are pretty solid for what they cost. The sound quality is clear, and they stay comfortable even after wearing them for a while. They connect fast and the battery life is actually better than I expected.My only real complaint is the volume control you can’t turn it up quickly, and it takes a few taps to get it where you want it. Not a dealbreaker, just annoying when you’re trying to adjust on the fly.Other than that, they work exactly how you’d hope budget earbuds would. For the price, they get the job done and sound good doing it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"I ordered these to have a reliable pair of noise-cancelling earbuds, and I am honestly blown away by the value. The sound quality is fantastic, the bass is punchy and powerful without drowning out the mids and highs. The noise cancellation works surprisingly well for this price point, blocking out a good amount of background noise when I'm working or commuting.One of my favorite features is actually the charging case. The built-in phone stand design is such a clever touch; it’s super handy for watching videos on my phone while I'm eating or traveling.The battery life is excellent (I haven't had to charge the case in days), and they are comfortable enough to wear for long sessions. If you want great sound and a functional design without breaking the bank, these are a solid choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker A20i True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I’d like to preface by saying that I just barely got these, so this is a first impression review (and also the only review I’ve ever felt compelled to make on Amazon). But I’ve gotta say, I already love these a lot. I’ve never been able to afford good quality earbuds, so I’m constantly looking for better, cheaper options - usually to no avail. But the sound quality of these for the price are FANTASTIC. Easily the best sounding earbuds I have ever owned, coming from somewhat of an audiophile. Not only that, but I also have small ears and tend to avoid earbuds all together due to the fact that earbuds generally really hurt my ears…but these? Light weight, they fit nicely in my ear, and they provide smaller ear cushions as well, which I would usually have to take advantage of and I haven’t had to change them - at least not yet. The app that pairs with them is really nice as well. It has an equalizer that you can utilize to adjust the audio to your own preference - which I personally haven’t had to use, as I actually find the audio out of the box really balanced - and you can also actually reprogram the gestures to pause/play/etc to your liking if you don’t like how they come. The app also has different audios you can listen to, from white noise, to rain, to the ocean, to a forest, etc., which I think is a great, considerate thing to add to the app. Incredibly easy set up as well. You take them out of the case, they blink for a second, and then immediately show up in your list to connect to in your bluetooth settings right out of the box. Nothing complicated at all. They also came fully charged which I was pleasantly surprised with. No having to wait around for them to charge to be able to actually try them upon receiving them. If I had to be nitpicky (as I know I’ve been only saying positive things) I’d say the only thing I’m not overly pleased with is just the fact that the charging case feels a little bit cheap, plastic wise. That being said, I really like the strap that comes attached to the case to put on keys or a carabiner or something of the like (and yes, you can take it off!), and it’s not like I expected the case to have the feel of an airpods case - you get what you pay for. It doesn’t feel like it would break easily, though. Just a bit cheap-feeling to the touch, which isn’t a big deal. Overall I would say that, so far, these are definitely a steal for their price. I happened to get them on sale for $18, but even the list price of $30 is worth it. If you’re wanting good quality wireless earbuds that won’t break the bank, these are definitely them. I’ll make sure to update/edit if my feelings on these change, but as of now, no real complaints! 10/10!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker A20i True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"Battery life is longer than 9 hours. I got them at 630pm charged em for maybe n hour put em on around 730ish and fell asleep with em in and they were at 10% at 10am the next morning. I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the ""soundcore buds battery at 10%"" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Update Sept. 2025 5months later.Everything above still applies. Both buds still work and I way overwork these things. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have an earbud in more in a 24 hour period then I do not my wife constantly tells me how horrible it is for my ears to wear them and fall asleep with them in the way I do lol and I only charge them once a day, I could probably go once every 2 days if I forgot to charge them once but I choose to charge the case fully for work at night and I've never had the charging case even blink red. They're literally working all day and I switch them back and forth. Not a glitch or anything and the battery life is still top notch and sound quality has not dipped at all. I'm even more baffled that I use them the way I do and they still work like new 5 months later. I actually came here to buy another pair so I can leave a pair at work and one at home so I'm not using one pair to death the way I currently do. Buy em. I have a buddy who has the 10mm driver's and they're not as good as these. If your doom scrolling through Amazon looking for the right ones I'm telling you try these. It's barely $20 if you don't like em you only spent $20 but I'm 100% honest with my review and highly recommend buying these.Your welcome",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"So far I gotta give these 5 stars the sound is amazing and they do not fall out like airpods which is exactly how I would end up loosing them. I like how you can adjust the equalizer on the soundcore app to your liking, the wireless charging for the case is an amazing feature on budget ear buds. It was very easy to set up and pick the correct wing size for better comfort. The design of these is amazing at first I found them to be a bit bulky but you end up getting used to it. Amazing now I gotta see if they last tho but so far they’re syncing perfectly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"These have been the best earbuds I've come across so far. I do not know why the ear wings aren't on all earbuds, they are so comfortable and clearly keep them from falling out of your ear, which is my biggest nuisance with a lot of them, as you start to feel it sliding out. These fit perfect, can't fall out. Now onto the sound.....the bass on these are so gooood! The overall sound quality for these earbuds are amazing. When I use these I don't feel I am missing out in comparison to over the head headphones. I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I love these earbuds! They fit in my ears really well, they're lightweight, and they actually stay in place. The noise cancellation is amazing. They literally drown out everything else. The sound quality is great, too—nice and sharp. There's different equalizer modes based on the type of music you're listening to, as well, and you can even set the touch controls exactly the way you want them. Definitely worth the price!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels ""cheap"" or ""flimsy"". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a ""Soundcore Signature BassUp"". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"Soundcore (a division of Anker Tech along with Eufy) has become my go to reliable source for fairly priced, great sounding, well-designed audio equipment, and these Liberty Buds are no exception. The fin designed to hold each bud in the ears works perfectly for me using the default medium size. I'm trying to use buds that are not ""in ear"" to help protect my hearing and these accomplish that while still sounding great. The noise cancelling is good at best, but because these are neither over nor fully in the ear, I wasn't expecting more. Sound is very good, especially bass response given the design, with the mids well represented and treble sweet and without sibilance. At the introductory 20 off price these are a no brainer, and even at full price they're easy to recommend.For millions of people, Anker has become synonymous with quality, feature rich, stylish products and an excellent price point. The Liberty Buds continue that trend and are a welcome addition to the family.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"Short version. These are great if you like open earbuds, as I do. The sound is great, they are comfortable, and unlike the Apple AirPods which still fall out of my ears frequently, the Liberty Buds offer a very secure fit. My only complaint is that I did not find the ANC to be very effective compared with the Apple AirPods 4 ANC.The Apple ANC is amazing, especially considering they are also open earbud design. The Apple ANC does not eliminate the background noise, but significantly lowers the volume on background noise. The effect of the ANC on the Liberty Buds was better than nothing, but significantly less effective than the Apple ANC.Whether or not comparing these Liberty Buds to the AirPods 4 ANC is fair or not depends on the price. This Christmas, the AirPods 4 ANC were widely available for $99. However, normally the Apple Air Pods 4 ANC are nearly twice the price of the Libery Buds. Thus, the fair comparison may be against the Apple AirPods with no ANC to the Liberty Buds with minimal ANC. In this case, some ANC is better than none and the Liberty Buds offer better fit and better controls. The only other issue is whether you are part of the Apple ecosystem.Although marginally improved, I still hate the way that Apple AirPods fall out of my ears. The Liberty Buds are very secure, yet very comfortable. I have fallen asleep and still had them in my ear. I also like the ability to customize the controls as well as the ability to have one of those controls set to control the volume on the buds. Compared to my previous Soundcore products, I love the ear detection. I can pause whatever is playing by simply pulling a bud out of my ear. Great for when you need to listen or talk.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"This is Soundcore's best headset yet... It is similar to the Airpod 4 / Samsung Galaxy Bud 3 with an open fit... The sound is extremely loud when on phone calls and listeners say I'm very clear. It blocks out a good amount of sounds. It is extremely light and comfortable. I forget it's there. It edges out the Airpod 3 and Samsung Galaxy Bud 3 because it comes with a ""fin"" that prevents it from falling out of your ear. You will be happy. They are offering $20 off as an introductory offer. You will be happy with them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"I own a number of SoundCore products including A20 and A30 sleep buds and I've had extensive experience with both the tech and customer service sides of Anker's business. While I'm used to in-ear buds I hoped that the design of the Liberty buds would be less likely to irritate the inside of my ears while still delivering decent sound. The idea would be to have buds that can function well in different environments including the gym while not being stuck inside the user's ear canal. Here's my quick review:-The sound quality is quite good and actually better than I expected. The quality if very good, connectivity no problem and the range of the buds from the app on your phone is better than either Bose or Apple. As with other SoundCore products the app is pretty intuitive and the number of features is excellent. It's apparent that Anker is focused on constant updates of their software and actually listens to customer feedback to their engineers.-Part of the attraction to the buds was the language translation feature and with limited use I found that the translation delay does work pretty well with minimal delay. It's clear that Anker is working to become competitive with Apple and Bose at a lower cost for this feature.-Now for the deal breaker (at least for me). The other SoundCore buds have a very good design that uses different size ""fins"" to fit inside the interior of your ear while not being ""inside"" your ear canal. I've had very good luck with both the A20 and A30 sleep buds fit and expected the fin design of the Liberty buds to be similar. Nope, not so much.  The fin design is much different and despite a few days of trying to find the right fin and trying to insert the bud correctly in my ear I realized that the Liberty buds were simply not for me or my ear design and both the comfort and sound quality are both negatively affected by how loose the buds are inside the user's ear. In addition, unless the fit is 100% right the feeling is that the buds will fall out.-I'm not sure why SoundCore chose to use this design or what the overall use profile is (for me certainly not the gym or on the bike) but that is certainly because of the fit issue for me. While SoundCore's customer service is excellent there's really no way that they can help fine tune fit over the phone or online. Perhaps my expectations and use profile don't fit the Liberty buds but because of my previous SoundCore experience I hoped for a better design. I'll have to stick with my old Bose Sport Buds for the time being.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"Incredible battery life and sound quality. Got these and AirPod pros and these were $150 less and are a much superior product. Returned the AirPod pros. Huge fan of Anker Soundcore products. Run a lot and spend lots of time in the gym, these have never been less then 50% charged. Only charged them once a week and they stay charged and automatically connect to iPhone. Great product!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty Buds by Anker,Soundcore,"I really enjoy the wingtip style earbud design.  This one can be worn comfortably for hours and feels very secure.  Sound quality is good, probably a 3.5/5, but it can depend on your seal.  Great transparency mode, but only average in noise cancelling.  Battery seems average.  Easy to set up and connect with the app.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro by Anker,Soundcore,"I've been using these since March 2025. I normally am not a fan of earbuds, I find them uncomfortable to wear after more than 30 minutes. However I ordered memory foam earpads has the ear pads that come with this headset didn't quite fit. With that one small $5 purchase of memory foam ear pads these earbuds turned out to be amazing. They have excellent noise canceling property, they are extremely comfortable to wear for hours at a time and I even forget I have them inserted.Sound quality is amazing, I'm a big fan of hearing bass when I listen to music and these do not disappoint. You can download an app for your phone to use them which is optional, but by downloading the app you can utilize a fit test to see how well the noise canceling is working.Telephone calls, no problem with the listener hearing me and vice versa.Not that it matters but the aesthetic is excellent because I like blue and I chose that model color.Battery life is highly impressive, once you charge the case you can use it for multiple recharges to the earbuds before you have to recharge the case. A bonus is that the case will work on a wireless charger and a wired charger depending on what you prefer to use.Overall, the price point is amazing considering that these are not some of the top of the line models that you may have heard about yet these perform at top of the line. I see no reason to purchase name brand earbuds for something that does the job if not exceeds the ones that are at the top of the line.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro by Anker,Soundcore,"I am a serious music listener, and own many top-tier IEMs. My experience has always been that wireless IEMs are far inferior to wired. I purchased the Liberty 4 Pro as a replacement for my AKG N400 TWS set, which have gone kaput. I bought the Liberty 4 Pro on sale for $89, so I expected them to be functional, but not exceptional. My mistake.While these don't rival my best sets, they are a tremendous performance/price set. On a scale of 1-10, where my top set (ISN Audio EST80) is a 9, these are a solid 6.5. That's huge. My old AKGs were a 4 at best. Everything about the Liberty Pro is amazing. The sound is wonderful, really. But it's the sophistication of the electronics that makes them really shine. Let's talk about that.The case is excellent and charges the IEMs rapidly. One word of caution - if you change the eartips to a non-OEM pair, be certain they fit the case properly, or your IEMs may not charge. Onward --The app is where all the stuff happens. There are hearing tests to help you design a custom EQ profile along with 22 built-in EQ profiles. If there isn't one there that tweaks these IEMs to you liking, check your hearing. These are all well designed, and very effective. There are so many options to customize your listening experience. I'm really impressed.The ANC is superb and, unlike my old AKGs, the quality of the sound doesn't change as you increase/decrease the ANC. That really impressed me.All in all, these are not just excellent TWS IEMs, but excellent IEMs all around. Depending on your music choices and listening habits, these might just be the only IEMs you need.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro by Anker,Soundcore,"Premium buds at an affordable pric. Very good sound quality, excellent battery performance and noise cancelling. The dual pairing is the feature that was lacking in lower models of Soundcore buds. This is the 4th pair of these that i have bought. Not because the others have failed, but because i use them in different places for different things and just love them. One pair at the office paired to my phone and computer. One in my home office again paired with phone and computer. One in my workshop paired with the TV and phone and one for travel paired with my phone and tablet. They just work, are very comfortable and the noise cancelling is spectacular. I knocked one start off for the tips themselves. I like the ""mushy"" tips and have tried several replacement ones but they never seem to fit in the case so prevent charging. Finally gave up and just got used to the included tips and have been happy ever since.",4.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"Let me start out by saying that this is a very solid/compelling product in this price range.

In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.

soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds,Soundcore,"I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.

Not only do I have issues with getting a proper seal in my ear canal, but they also don't seat well in my ear, as they tend to fall out more easily.  I don't seem to have this issue with some other earbuds(like the Earfun Air Pro 4), but I do have this issue with the Liberty 4 NC's.  I will say that it's not necessarily a deal breaker though, just an annoyance, something to watch out for as it depends on your ears.Second qualm is the mic performance is just mediocre, though it is adequate for it's price class.I don't use transparency mode very often, but they seem to work ok.  I'm glad that these have a transparency mode at least.---I also wanted to note, as I alluded to earlier, that I have both the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC and the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.  I have tested both of these in a noisy cafe, and the Liberty 4 NC's noise cancelling is noticeably superior to the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  So depending on your priorities, I'd still say overall, I prefer the Liberty 4 NC's.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.  My wife called me when I was out while using the earfuns and she said I sounded fine.  I have not used these so far to talk on the phone while I ride so I cannot speak to that.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don’t like.They Liberty’s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation on the Liberty’s is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I’m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don’t like with the Liberty’s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i’s don’t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that’s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty’s have an option to set up your “ideal listening EQ” and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC’s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can’t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.Not knocking any of these, just trying to give an honest opinion to those who are debating  price/quality",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Sleep A30 by Anker Sleep Earbuds,Soundcore,"Full disclosure - I have smaller ears and canals, and I am a side sleeper and I have been using these for the last 7 days.I am moving to a new town and decided to rent an apartment for a year to help me decide where to buy a house.  Well, the apartment walls and floors are not well insulated.  I hear footsteps, creaking floors, snoring through the wall, and sometimes can hear the tv shows they watch.  Needless to say, I was having serious trouble sleeping.  I could fall asleep pretty well (go to bed early), but I would be awakened at some point, or several points, in the night by all these noises, banging, walking, creaking, and snoring and was not able to get back to sleep.  I needed something to help.I tried Mack's foam ear plugs.  They work pretty good for noise reduction, but my ears would hurt and throb making my sleep difficult in that way.  I even had the small ears size.  They were comfortable to side sleep with.I bought some fake Loop alternatives as just ear plugs.  They were comfortable, did not throb like the Mack's in my ears, but did not block out enough sound.  When I tried a bigger ear plug piece, I found the throbbing ear syndrome again.  These were comfortable to side sleep with though.I then bought a cheap knock off brand of ""sleep buds"".  They were the most comfortable thus far.  They would bluetooth to my phone so I could play either music or some white noise from my phone.  They claimed to have ANC.  They were helpful to block out some sound because of the ear fit, and because they could bluetooth to my phone for music or white noise.  However, with the ANC on or off, I did not detect any difference in sound reduction.  These were kidney bean shaped sleep buds and did not stick out much from my ear.  The ear plug piece was comfortable, but the harder plastic part would start to be annoying after a few hours when on my side.  They were ok.  Sound quality was decent. Maybe a C+ for an overall grade for these.  However, they didn't stop all the sounds and I still woke up occasionally.I hesitantly tried the A30's.  This is no small investment! With the rubbery ear plug piece and ear fin, these buds were comfortable.  While on my side, they have been the most comfortable thus far.  I can sleep well with them in actually.  I still have a little bit of pressure while on my side, but some nifty pillow management helped relieve the pressure.  I am using the attachments they came with out of the box. I really like the white noise sounds.  I have Still Lake as my favorite.  It is a sutble sound that helps my brain drift off.  With the fit of the A30 alone, I can block out most of the noise for the night with these standard size pieces without using ANC.  Last night, I had both my wife snoring and banging on the ceiling above.  (To be honest, my wife's snoring is not super loud but enough to wake me up). Then I realized I didn't have the ANC on.  Well, i turned the ANC on and WOW what a difference.  It was almost like I had over the ear headphones with ANC on.  All that noise disappeared.  I was very impressed, at least I recall being impressed.  I was asleep!!The sound quality is perfect for night time sleeping.  In reading other reviews, I agree that these are not your everyday all day ear buds, they are really designed for sleeping only.  The ANC works really well and I noted quite a difference between on and off.Last night I set them to use ANC until I was alseep and then go to local mode.  After 8 hours, I still had 30% of the battery left in each ear bud.  So far, the battery life has been great.  I have yet to spend a whole night with bluetooth and ANC on, however.  I haven't needed to.I know at $200 it seems like a lot to spend for ear buds that you only use for sleep and that aren't designed for super high quality audio sounds.  However, this week has been the best sleep week I've had in two months since those neighbors upstairs moved in.  You do need several nights to get used to the fit and feel.  Not because they are uncomfortable, but because when something new is in your ear and you aren't used to it, it can feel funny and weird which may keep you awake instead of helping you sleep.  But, give it a few nights, and if you are like me, they get more comfortable the more you wear them.  I can sleep on my side with these but I need a soft pillow.  A really firm pillow would hurt my ears after a few hours, as it would everyone else with anything in their ear.Everyone is a different size and shape, but I have found these A30's to be comfortable, and of high quality.  The app is full of options to help customize the experience, and they do what they claim they will do.  After this week, my wife (who is very thrifty) is asking if she can try these out and maybe get a pair because she notices such a difference in my morning wakefulness. Hope this helps those of you out there like me needed something to help get your sleep back.  I would definitely buy again and am grateful for this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Sleep A30 by Anker Sleep Earbuds,Soundcore,"As I get older, I find that I have more difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep. I usually have an air filter running to drown out unwanted noises, but following a recent trip out of town, I discovered I need something that I can easily travel with. I tried a couple of cheaper sleep earbuds of different sizes and simply could not sleep with them in. I have fairly small ears and am a side sleeper. I finally gave up trying to find an economical solution and purchased the Soundcore Sleep A30. The case is very smooth and pleasant to the touch. It feels high-end and of good quality. The buds themselves are really tiny! The silicone tips and wings are squishy and flexible. I love that Soundcore included a variety of tips and wings for a custom fit, and I selected the smallest sizes available. It was really easy to swap them out and they fit snugly in my ears. I am not concerned about them falling out, and if they do happen to get lost, there is a handy function in the settings that makes them beep at a very high decibel. Connecting to Bluetooth was not overtly complicated, but I do recommend using the QR Code in the box to read the user manual before getting started. My first night to sleep with the earbuds was a bit challenging, but I think I may have had the buds positioned incorrectly. Last night I turned the buds more horizontally according to the picture in the user manual and was able to sleep through the night. Once placed in a proper position, they were quite comfortable. The battery seems to be very good so far, and it lasted the whole night. The app has a ton of settings and options. You can even create your own white noise mix. The app and the user manual provide tips on how to maximize battery life using various settings. Local mode seems to be a better choice than Bluetooth mode for longevity. I noted the ACN works wonderfully for low frequency noises, though you do have to give it a couple of minutes to fully kick in. It almost eliminates the noise of an annoying ceiling fan in my office, but I can still hear when someone sends a chat message. There is functionality for making and receiving phone calls in the app settings, though I do not have that turned on and have not tested it, yet. I am not an audiophile, but music and shows sound fine to me. I am hesitantly optimistic that I finally found sleep earbuds that will work for me!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P40i by Anker,Soundcore,"I got these as a lower-cost replacement for the 1st generation AirPods Pro that I had used for a few years (before one of the pods finally met its unfortunate demise), and I’d say they’re just about as good all-around as those were. The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I’m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore’s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I’m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I’m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple’s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple’s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I’ve accepted that earbuds in general just won’t last forever with daily use, so it doesn’t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I’m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore’s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P40i by Anker,Soundcore,"So I have been a huge audiophile my entire life driven with rhythm and sound of nature and creation. I have tried many audio devices and have never quite had the experience that I've been able to receive from soundcore audio. I have purchased the p20, p3i, p40i's twice (one for me and my wife), I also have the space q45, I also recently purchased and reviewed the Aero Fit pro.As far as the p40i they fit a lot differently than the p3is. I personally had issues keeping them in my ears without them falling out which led to their demise in a toilet. However while I had them their voice quality seemed unmatched. Posting the capacity for six mics not only does the noise canceling work amazingly. Near comparable to the q45s capacity. The sound distribution is fantastic providing a deep into you sound.  Touch base control makes it interesting and easy to trigger. In my opinion they are not set up for movement like sports or other physical activities. Connectivity, functionality, battery life and volume control function flawlessly. And overall clarity and value for money they offer a little more than the cheaper variety.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Soundcore Sport X20 by Anker,Soundcore,"I own a pair of Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which I absolutely love for their amazing noise-canceling feature. They completely block out airplane noise — even when I’m seated right next to the wing — and are my go-to travel companion. However, once I started working out regularly, I quickly realized that my Bose earbuds weren’t ideal for the gym. They constantly fell out during strength training, and I got tired of picking them up off the floor mid-set.So I decided to try the Powerbeats Pro, which are heavily marketed for athletes. While they did stay securely on my ears during workouts, I was disappointed by the lack of noise cancellation. Despite the claims, there was virtually no difference between the noise-canceling and transparency modes, and for the price (nearly $300!), that was a huge letdown.After doing more research, I came across the Soundcore Sport earbuds. I already use several Anker products and have been happy with their quality, so while I was initially skeptical due to the lower price point, I decided to give it a try.First off, these earbuds have their own app — something the Powerbeats Pro didn’t. The app lets you customize sound modes, adjust bass, and fine-tune audio settings to your liking. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, on par with much more expensive earbuds. I tested them while walking around my neighborhood and during peak hours at the gym. I could barely hear people grunting or chatting nearby (which is one of my biggest gym pet peeves!).They also stay perfectly in place during strength training, which was my top priority. Combined with the excellent noise cancellation, these quickly became my new favorite pair of workout earbuds. I happily returned my Powerbeats Pro the very next day.If you’re looking for comfortable, secure earbuds with real noise cancellation and great sound quality at a reasonable price, these are a fantastic choice. You get premium features without the premium price tag — truly a great value and a solid purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Sport X20 by Anker,Soundcore,"Pretty good bang for your buck. Good sound; accompanying app is good but slightly more ambitious than it is reliable. It seems to have lost the ability to read the case/charger's charge level, but the light on the case still works for that purpose. Equalizer sometimes gets overwhelmed and won't switch settings. You get better battery life if you minimize use of app features and rely on the sound's source device for digital signal processing. Programmable control buttons is a pretty handy feature for me, but the buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. Reproduces Dolby Atmos immersive sound fairly decently. Fit in ears VERY WELL AND SNUG WITH NO COMFORT PROBLEMS. This simply cannot be overstated. Transparent and active noise canceling modes are nice. For the price, you probably can't go wrong with these.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Sport X20 by Anker,Soundcore,"These are a great fit, connect easily, and sound great too! Very impressed by what you get for the price. I had some Jabra Elite 8 Actives before this but had trouble keeping them in my ear during workouts. These stay in place and were less than half the price! I also love how much smoother and faster they connect to multiple Bluetooth sources. When I’m working they’re typically connected to both my iPhone and my laptop. When a call comes in on Teams or Jabber on my laptop, the music from my iPhone automatically pauses and allows me to take the call. My previous headphones didn’t work well in these situations.Good sound cancelling. Haven’t tried them while mowing yet.The only problems I’ve experienced are that 1) they occasionally drop the connection from my laptop in the middle of a long call and 2) when taking a call on Teams sometimes the ringing continues in my headphones after I’ve answered the call. (In that case, I hear both the person on the line and the ringing for ~5-10 seconds before the ringing stops.) Not sure if the root of these problems is the laptop (& its software) or the headphones. It’s entirely possible it’s the laptop. Regardless, these issues are occasional enough that I still am happy with the purchase.Great battery life! I charge mine ~2x a week for the 2-3 hrs I use them each day. Case is secure and the headphones seat easily to charge.One final positive - I had trouble with the microphone noise cancelling on my previous headphones when taking calls in the car. In other words, people on the other end couldn’t hear me easily. I drive an older truck thats somewhat loud, but these headphones have no problem cancelling out the background noise and allowing the person on the other end to hear me. (And yes, I’ve asked them!)Overall, an excellent value. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a single pair of headphones for work, working out, and taking calls in the car.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker P20i True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"This is my second pair of Sound Core earbuds. My first set lasted me for several years and I still use them, but thought I would have a second pair on hand just in case they fail. They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I’m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it’s running low. You can’t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I’ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200).

The sound quality is also surprisingly acceptable.I have not had these on long enough to test out battery life or what not. I use this for workouts, so no more than an hr or so of actual use a day.I hate the touch controls, so had to turn it off using the app. Thankfully they let you turn all of the touch controls via the app, plus turn off the noise\ping you hear when you brush up against the touch control....So this is as basic of use as you can get, which I look for in headphones.I am sick of haptic controls, touch controls, over-reliance of the accompanying app, and active noise cancelling features. All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage.

Despite the claims, there was virtually no difference between the noise-canceling and transparency modes, and for the price (nearly $300!), that was a huge letdown.After doing more research, I came across the Soundcore Sport earbuds. I already use several Anker products and have been happy with their quality, so while I was initially skeptical due to the lower price point, I decided to give it a try.First off, these earbuds have their own app — something the Powerbeats Pro didn’t. The app lets you customize sound modes, adjust bass, and fine-tune audio settings to your liking. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, on par with much more expensive earbuds. I tested them while walking around my neighborhood and during peak hours at the gym. I could barely hear people grunting or chatting nearby (which is one of my biggest gym pet peeves!).They also stay perfectly in place during strength training, which was my top priority. Combined with the excellent noise cancellation, these quickly became my new favorite pair of workout earbuds. I happily returned my Powerbeats Pro the very next day.If you’re looking for comfortable, secure earbuds with real noise cancellation and great sound quality at a reasonable price, these are a fantastic choice. You get premium features without the premium price tag — truly a great value and a solid purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore Sport X20 by Anker,Soundcore,"Pretty good bang for your buck. Good sound; accompanying app is good but slightly more ambitious than it is reliable. It seems to have lost the ability to read the case/charger's charge level, but the light on the case still works for that purpose. Equalizer sometimes gets overwhelmed and won't switch settings. You get better battery life if you minimize use of app features and rely on the sound's source device for digital signal processing. Programmable control buttons is a pretty handy feature for me, but the buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. Reproduces Dolby Atmos immersive sound fairly decently. Fit in ears VERY WELL AND SNUG WITH NO COMFORT PROBLEMS. This simply cannot be overstated. Transparent and active noise canceling modes are nice. For the price, you probably can't go wrong with these.",4.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore Sport X20 by Anker,Soundcore,"These are a great fit, connect easily, and sound great too! Very impressed by what you get for the price. I had some Jabra Elite 8 Actives before this but had trouble keeping them in my ear during workouts. These stay in place and were less than half the price! I also love how much smoother and faster they connect to multiple Bluetooth sources. When I’m working they’re typically connected to both my iPhone and my laptop. When a call comes in on Teams or Jabber on my laptop, the music from my iPhone automatically pauses and allows me to take the call. My previous headphones didn’t work well in these situations.Good sound cancelling. Haven’t tried them while mowing yet.The only problems I’ve experienced are that 1) they occasionally drop the connection from my laptop in the middle of a long call and 2) when taking a call on Teams sometimes the ringing continues in my headphones after I’ve answered the call. (In that case, I hear both the person on the line and the ringing for ~5-10 seconds before the ringing stops.) Not sure if the root of these problems is the laptop (& its software) or the headphones. It’s entirely possible it’s the laptop. Regardless, these issues are occasional enough that I still am happy with the purchase.Great battery life! I charge mine ~2x a week for the 2-3 hrs I use them each day. Case is secure and the headphones seat easily to charge.One final positive - I had trouble with the microphone noise cancelling on my previous headphones when taking calls in the car. In other words, people on the other end couldn’t hear me easily. I drive an older truck thats somewhat loud, but these headphones have no problem cancelling out the background noise and allowing the person on the other end to hear me. (And yes, I’ve asked them!)Overall, an excellent value. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a single pair of headphones for work, working out, and taking calls in the car.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"The Soundcore P31i earbuds by Anker truly impressed me. The sound quality is clear, rich, and powerful, with immersive spatial audio and excellent real-time adaptive noise cancelling. They fit comfortably in my ears, even during long listening sessions, and feel secure without causing discomfort.I’ve used Apple AirPods for years, but these earbuds have easily become my favorite. The Hi-Res sound, long 50-hour battery life, fast charging, and IP55 water resistance make them perfect for everyday use. Bluetooth connectivity is smooth, and the added translation feature is a great bonus.For the price, the quality is outstanding—easily one of the best values I’ve experienced in wireless earbuds. Highly recommended for anyone looking for premium features without the premium price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"These earbuds are great. Just got mind last week. They sound good especially for the price. The ANC works good and wind quieting is good.

Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"WOW! It takes a lot these days for a purchase to genuinely blow me away, especially in the age of the countless low priced, questionable quality “audiophile grade” true wireless options out there. I have a pair on Sennheisser HD660s and Grado sr80s powered through a Fiios K5 Pro for at home listening. I needed something for the gym, being out and about, and most importantly travel.THESE THINGS ARE THE BEST TRUE WIRELESS EAR BUDS I HAVE EVER USED. Greatly prefer these to AirPods. I was expecting just a decent sounding pair of Bluetooth earbuds and had proper expectations for the super low price of these. What I got is something that has to be experienced to convey just how awesome these things are.Quick Pros/Things That Jumped Out-Extremely comfortable fit with a wide range of sizes for every ear canal > the App literally will run a test to check if you have a proper seal to ensure the best sound-THE APP! This is what has blown me away the most. This thing is BEAUTIFULLY designed and has some of the coolest features I have ever seen implemented in Bluetooth headphones:-running a hearing test to tell each separate ear’s overall health when it comes to noise exposure and being able to pick up frequencies-Ability to toggle between different modes(music, spatial, movie, games)-Ability to adjust the degree of active noise cancellation, including different modes such as adaptive which will automatically adjust, being able to amplify sounds coming from a TV in the background for example, being able to have a conversation without pausing your music-THE EQ IS SO IMPRESSIVE. It runs a series of A B tests to determine your distinct sound preferences to multiple variations of the same song where you choose if either A or B sounds better.-Connection is effortless, the buttons are not only easy to actually use on the ear buds, but they are fully customizable-COMFORT. I have been wearing these for 5 hours now and I’m not exaggerating when I say I don’t even notice them. Haven’t had to take them out a single time to let my “ears breathe”-Super durable build. Was surprised by the heft of the case and buds themselves-MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL- The sound quality is simply unparalleled as far as Bluetooth buds go. I would buy these for $200 without question. The EQ makes it so no matter your preference, you can tweak the sound to exactly how you like it. The fidelity, clarity, bass, highs, vocals, etc all shine.This is one of the best purchases I have made in years and could not be more pleased",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"I upgraded to the P31i from  the P30i and the difference is dramatic in every respect. More refined sound quality, a giant leap in Noise Cancellation,  ergonomics of tapping have improved significantly, connection speed...basically in every respect a vast improvement. Definitely worth the upgrade, especially for the incredibly cheap price they are being offered for.I give them 4 stars though for one reason: The darned case. It's horrible. Soundcore must have put together a design group with the challenge to create the worst possible case for these otherwise brilliant earphones. The surface is slippery like a small bar of wet soap. The case is jet black and top and bottom are exactly the same other than a microscopic and virtually invisible Soundcore logo on top. The catch to open it is also very small and uncomfortable so the soap case can slip out of your hands. I had to paint a big white dot on the top left hand corner to orient myself and use extreme caution every time I open the case. A shame for what are otherwise such brilliant earphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"The Soundcore P31i by Anker delivers outstanding quality for both music and calls. The Hi-Res LDAC audio is crisp, with deep bass and clear vocals, making every track enjoyable. Connectivity is seamless — pairing is instant, and multipoint support makes switching between devices effortless. Comfort is excellent too: the lightweight design and snug fit make them easy to wear for hours without fatigue. Durability is impressive: the IP55 rating keeps them safe from sweat and rain, and the sturdy case feels built to last. Adaptive noise cancelling works brilliantly in different environments, while the real-time translation feature adds unique value for travel. With long battery life and fast charging, these earbuds are reliable for everyday use. Overall, they combine premium sound, comfort, smart features, and rugged design at a great price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore P31i by Anker,Soundcore,"I got these on Black Friday and am very happy! I have tiny ears and Apple AirPods are too large. These fit really well and are comfortable. The sound is good and I really like the app. The selection of background noise effects is quite large, which is great when I need to concentrate while commuting on public transit. The ANC is effective as well.I previously used the Jabra Elite Pro 7 earbuds, which are more expensive and the right ear buds stopped charging on 2 different sets.The only thing that I do not like is that the case is fairly large. It is almost twice the size the Jabra Elite Pro 7 case but if the battery life is longer & charging is faster, it's acceptable.Overall, the P31i are a great value for the cost. I just got them so I am unsure about the durability or battery life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Space A40 Auto-Adjustable Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I finally ended up with these earbuds after a nightmare journey having traded in my perfectly great Samsung (first series) earbuds for the new Samsung buds pro 2, which it turned out I am totally allergic to and couldn't even wear for 10 minutes without getting a severe reaction, shame on you Samsung, they know they have a big problem and refused to return and refund me the buds.So here the journey starts, and shout out to Best Buy who took back and refunded every pair I bought! As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and  upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case,  the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me.

Soundcore by Anker Space A40 Auto-Adjustable Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"Final update - the right earbud issue has yet to repeat, so that's not an issue. As I've said, I have four other top end earbuds, and the only pair I use is the Soundcore A40. We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights. The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.",5.0 out of 5 stars

soundcore Sleep A30 by Anker Sleep Earbuds,Soundcore,"Full disclosure - I have smaller ears and canals, and I am a side sleeper and I have been using these for the last 7 days.I am moving to a new town and decided to rent an apartment for a year to help me decide where to buy a house.  Well, the apartment walls and floors are not well insulated.  I hear footsteps, creaking floors, snoring through the wall, and sometimes can hear the tv shows they watch.  Needless to say, I was having serious trouble sleeping.  I could fall asleep pretty well (go to bed early), but I would be awakened at some point, or several points, in the night by all these noises, banging, walking, creaking, and snoring and was not able to get back to sleep.  I needed something to help.I tried Mack's foam ear plugs.  They work pretty good for noise reduction, but my ears would hurt and throb making my sleep difficult in that way.  I even had the small ears size.  They were comfortable to side sleep with.I bought some fake Loop alternatives as just ear plugs.  They were comfortable, did not throb like the Mack's in my ears, but did not block out enough sound.  When I tried a bigger ear plug piece, I found the throbbing ear syndrome again.  These were comfortable to side sleep with though.I then bought a cheap knock off brand of ""sleep buds"".  They were the most comfortable thus far.  They would bluetooth to my phone so I could play either music or some white noise from my phone.  They claimed to have ANC.  They were helpful to block out some sound because of the ear fit, and because they could bluetooth to my phone for music or white noise.  However, with the ANC on or off, I did not detect any difference in sound reduction.  These were kidney bean shaped sleep buds and did not stick out much from my ear.  The ear plug piece was comfortable, but the harder plastic part would start to be annoying after a few hours when on my side.  They were ok.  Sound quality was decent. Maybe a C+ for an overall grade for these.  However, they didn't stop all the sounds and I still woke up occasionally.I hesitantly tried the A30's.  This is no small investment! With the rubbery ear plug piece and ear fin, these buds were comfortable.  While on my side, they have been the most comfortable thus far.  I can sleep well with them in actually.  I still have a little bit of pressure while on my side, but some nifty pillow management helped relieve the pressure.  I am using the attachments they came with out of the box. I really like the white noise sounds.  I have Still Lake as my favorite.  It is a sutble sound that helps my brain drift off.  With the fit of the A30 alone, I can block out most of the noise for the night with these standard size pieces without using ANC.  Last night, I had both my wife snoring and banging on the ceiling above.  (To be honest, my wife's snoring is not super loud but enough to wake me up). Then I realized I didn't have the ANC on.  Well, i turned the ANC on and WOW what a difference.  It was almost like I had over the ear headphones with ANC on.  All that noise disappeared.  I was very impressed, at least I recall being impressed.  I was asleep!!The sound quality is perfect for night time sleeping.  In reading other reviews, I agree that these are not your everyday all day ear buds, they are really designed for sleeping only.  The ANC works really well and I noted quite a difference between on and off.Last night I set them to use ANC until I was alseep and then go to local mode.  After 8 hours, I still had 30% of the battery left in each ear bud.  So far, the battery life has been great.  I have yet to spend a whole night with bluetooth and ANC on, however.  I haven't needed to.I know at $200 it seems like a lot to spend for ear buds that you only use for sleep and that aren't designed for super high quality audio sounds.  However, this week has been the best sleep week I've had in two months since those neighbors upstairs moved in.  You do need several nights to get used to the fit and feel.  Not because they are uncomfortable, but because when something new is in your ear and you aren't used to it, it can feel funny and weird which may keep you awake instead of helping you sleep.  But, give it a few nights, and if you are like me, they get more comfortable the more you wear them.  I can sleep on my side with these but I need a soft pillow.  A really firm pillow would hurt my ears after a few hours, as it would everyone else with anything in their ear.Everyone is a different size and shape, but I have found these A30's to be comfortable, and of high quality.  The app is full of options to help customize the experience, and they do what they claim they will do.  After this week, my wife (who is very thrifty) is asking if she can try these out and maybe get a pair because she notices such a difference in my morning wakefulness. Hope this helps those of you out there like me needed something to help get your sleep back.  I would definitely buy again and am grateful for this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore Sleep A30 by Anker Sleep Earbuds,Soundcore,"As I get older, I find that I have more difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep. I usually have an air filter running to drown out unwanted noises, but following a recent trip out of town, I discovered I need something that I can easily travel with. I tried a couple of cheaper sleep earbuds of different sizes and simply could not sleep with them in. I have fairly small ears and am a side sleeper. I finally gave up trying to find an economical solution and purchased the Soundcore Sleep A30. The case is very smooth and pleasant to the touch. It feels high-end and of good quality. The buds themselves are really tiny! The silicone tips and wings are squishy and flexible. I love that Soundcore included a variety of tips and wings for a custom fit, and I selected the smallest sizes available. It was really easy to swap them out and they fit snugly in my ears. I am not concerned about them falling out, and if they do happen to get lost, there is a handy function in the settings that makes them beep at a very high decibel. Connecting to Bluetooth was not overtly complicated, but I do recommend using the QR Code in the box to read the user manual before getting started. My first night to sleep with the earbuds was a bit challenging, but I think I may have had the buds positioned incorrectly. Last night I turned the buds more horizontally according to the picture in the user manual and was able to sleep through the night. Once placed in a proper position, they were quite comfortable. The battery seems to be very good so far, and it lasted the whole night. The app has a ton of settings and options. You can even create your own white noise mix. The app and the user manual provide tips on how to maximize battery life using various settings. Local mode seems to be a better choice than Bluetooth mode for longevity. I noted the ACN works wonderfully for low frequency noises, though you do have to give it a couple of minutes to fully kick in. It almost eliminates the noise of an annoying ceiling fan in my office, but I can still hear when someone sends a chat message. There is functionality for making and receiving phone calls in the app settings, though I do not have that turned on and have not tested it, yet. I am not an audiophile, but music and shows sound fine to me. I am hesitantly optimistic that I finally found sleep earbuds that will work for me!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore AeroClip by Anker,Soundcore,"I spent at least 10 hours looking for And watching videos about in the ear and over-the-ear earbuds.I got these as a Christmas present to myself and I couldn't be happier.All the videos were true, I purchased them for $99 before Christmas and they are excellent!It's the first pair of over-the-ear earbuds I've ever owned and I love them. I've always owned the noise canceling in ear earbuds but after hours of listening, they're so uncomfortable. But obviously that's a difference between the two.I like them because I can hear everything around me at a lower volume, situational awareness, yet they're loud enough to drown out outside noise depending on what you're doing.They're so comfortable I literally don't even feel them on my ears. Emphasis, on my ears. Additionally, they will never fall off no matter what you're doing, unless you're boxing or wrestling.The sound is great, the app is great and the comfort is perfect.They connect to two devices at once and while you're watching one and then switch to the other it changes flawlessly and goes back flawlessly. IE, TV to phone.Based on my OCD research, they are perfect for what I need them for. Hearing outside noise when I want to and being loud enough when I'm outside.I almost forgot, the call clarity is perfect. I can hear everyone. And when I tell them I have these new earbuds in they tell me they can hear me perfectly, indoors and outside.Like I said, I reviewed so many for hours and decided on these. I'm so glad I did.5 stars all the way. Not one negative thing about them.Oh, And the battery life lasts forever. I've had them in my ears for over 7 hours and they still held up. The app will tell you how much battery life remains and how much battery is left in your charging case. And I think if you drop them in the case for 15 or 30 minutes you get another 3 hours of use. I'm guessing 30 minutes in the case, they're fully charged.Anker, who I thought was only battery chargers owns soundcore. I still have one of their battery chargers from 10 years ago and it's working like the day bought it.I really hope this long review convinces you to buy what I was hoping for. Which is exactly what wanted and got.And I wish more normal people like me would post like I just did, to let people know honestly what they should buy without being sent one for free and then BSing everyone.Wait until they're on sale for $99 again.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore AeroClip by Anker,Soundcore,"I’ve been using AeroClips for a couple of months and they’ve been effortless. The clip‑on, open‑ear design is what makes them special: you get your music or podcasts clearly, but you’re never cut off from the world—no need to fight that pressure or feeling of sound trapped behind your ears. They feel ultra‑light, secure, and easy to forget you’re wearing them.Sound is clean and balanced, with good bass for an open style, and the app gives useful tweaks if you want to tune things. Battery life is solid—about a full day’s casual use—so I rarely worry about charging. Reviewers also note the comfy fit, reliable controls, and strong overall value for the price, which matches my experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore AeroClip by Anker,Soundcore,"I have a problem with earbuds. I use them mainly for exercise, so getting them to stay in place is the first issue that comes up. I treated myself to an expensive set: Powerbeats Pro 2. They stayed faithfully on my head during all exercise, but they sound awful. Their defect is that they have to be positioned with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION in order to deliver bass and midrange. Five minutes into my exercise routine and I have already lost it.The AeroClips work for me. They stay in place and deliver correct sound even if I stand on my head. I can wear them for two hours without discomfort, maybe more.To be fair, the Powerbeats are more fully-featured. They have wireless charging.  They have active noise reduction (mid, but still). They offer excellent integration with Apple products, including access to settings and battery levels from desktop, tablet, or phone. Also, twice as expensive.Too bad that those Powerbeats don't work for me. In fact, these AeroClips are the only buds I know of that do work.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore AeroClip by Anker,Soundcore,"These headphones are a fantastic option if you’re looking for something comfortable, low profile, and a little different from the typical over ear or in ear designs. What really sets them apart is how they project sound directly toward your ears with very little sound leakage  perfect for listening without disturbing people around you.A heads-up: when mine arrived, they weren’t charged out of the box. So, definitely make sure to charge them fully before trying to pair or test them out. Once charged, the pairing process was super simple and hassle-free. I also recommend downloading the Soundcore app if you want to fine-tune the sound output  it gives you more control over the listening experience.The comfort level is impressive. I threw them on, and within minutes I forgot I was even wearing them. The sound is clear and crisp, not overly bass heavy, and easy on the ears. I actually almost fell asleep wearing them that’s how comfortable they are.The only real downside is that they’re not sweat or water resistant. So if you’re planning to wear them during workouts or in unpredictable weather, just be aware. It would’ve been great if some level of water resistance was built in, but that’s really the only drawback I’ve found so far.Overall, these are a solid, unique pair of headphones for casual everyday use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore V20i by Anker Open-Ear Headphones,Soundcore,"This is the first time I've purchased a Soundcore product and I wasn't quite sure if I would like an open-ear ear bud. However, they were inexpensive, probably because they are an older model, so I decided to give them a try. They are wonderful. Super comfortable to wear, no having to stuff into my ear. The hook around the ear is soft and light weight yet it holds the phones very securely. The hook can be adjusted for a comfortable fit. I almost couldn't tell they were there.  I had no issue pairing the ear phones to my iPhone, just followed the included directions and pictures carefully.Sound quality is amazing. Clear highs, mid-tones, and great bass response. These levels can be adjusted in the Soundcore App if you'd like a different experience. Phone calls with only one ear bud worked well also. There was no problem  hearing or being heard. They charge remarkably fast too, which is a plus.The only controls set up initially are for music play/pause/skip and for answering/disconnecting a call. Controls can be customized in the Soundcore App to your preference. This includes volume controls as well as several others.I highly recommend these ear buds. They are some of the best I've ever owned for a very budget conscious price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore V20i by Anker Open-Ear Headphones,Soundcore,"Excellent ear phones for an incredible bargain (got at 50% off). Have only used in-ear headphones before, and they were never comfortable and never stayed in my ears no matter what I tried (all the different size tips, over the ear versions, etc.). These stay in place, are so comfortable I don’t even remember I have them on, and the sound quality is excellent. They are very customizable for sound and control functionality. Can be a little annoying because the controls are touch-sensitive, so it is hard to put them on without accidentally touching the controls. If you want a want a simple plug-and-play, these aren’t it. But the minor annoyance is worth the comfort and sound quality. The company offers many features through the app. I will likely never use any of them (I just want simple ear buds), but nice to have the option if I ever change my mind.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore V20i by Anker Open-Ear Headphones,Soundcore,"Connectivity: Pairing was easy and straight forward; audio quality is great (particularly once equalizer was adjusted to my taste. Oh, and for those new to Anker Soundcore products, you WILL need to download the APP to access and use full features); they fit perfectly fine around my ears with no danger of falling off/out even when I vigorously shake my head; sound quality did NOT alter once I put on my knit winter cap as regularly occurs with standard earbuds due to the buds inside the ear canal being depressed further inside or otherwise shifting around; while these may not be 'noise cancelling' they do still drown out plenty of ambient noise; volume is great! That does it for the Pros.Cons: Just one. There is NO WAY to determine the battery life of the CASE! In the app it shows the battery life of the individual buds. Great! But there is nothing for the case. I've got a pair of Soundcore SportX20 and these DO have an indicator for the case along with the buds. So I KNOW the technology exists. Why'd yo guys skimp on this feature? This is why I had to dock you One Star for this lapse.Otherwise, great product!Edit: Jan 2, 2026. Okay, so after I scanned the QR code for the on-line manual, I learned that the battery life reading for the case can be interpreted thus…when you re-install the ear buds into the case if the case light is STEADY, then there is 46% to 100% power. However, if the light is blinking then there remains anywhere from 45% to 0% power. So, if it’s blinking you may as well plug in and recharge. That’s something, but I still prefer a more accurate reading instead of a range.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore V20i by Anker Open-Ear Headphones,Soundcore,"I much prefer the open ear design instead of inner ear canal rubber buds.  These are comfortable with adjustable ear hooks and easy to connect.  Sound quality is not fabulous, but good, as expected for moderately priced technology.  You can download their App to your phone if you want to customize all the options like prerecorded background sounds like oceans and forests and white noise.  But these connect fine to devices that do not have a User Interface, like a device that connects to a TV audio out.  Works great with Alexa too.  I had a Bluetooth connection issue at first, contacted customer support and they were excellent helping me out.  Turned out the problem was on my end, the buds worked great.  The one minor critique is that the case does not have a battery level indicator LED.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore V20i by Anker Open-Ear Headphones,Soundcore,"Highly recommend these V20i Sound Core in comfort, clarity and are available at times as a good value for the quality. I originally received this model as a gift and was very impressed and bought a second set for my wife whom loved mine! The adjustable ear piece is a plus and so far seem to have really good battery life. Their SoundCore App for iPhone is one of the best I’ve used if needed. The iPhone app upgraded my headset firmware and you can also adjust the touch controls to your liking on both ear pieces.Note: Tho works on my iPhone fine, “Currently” this app isn’t available for download on Windows PC’s in the United States region. Our headsets also work BlueTooth connected with both the iPhone & my Windows11 PC; playing either takes precedence to the headset. I particularly like that the open ear type also works well for those who also need to hear some of what’s around you. And, for me no long term ear itch from an in the ear bud. These are great!",5.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore by Anker Space A40 Auto-Adjustable Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I finally ended up with these earbuds after a nightmare journey having traded in my perfectly great Samsung (first series) earbuds for the new Samsung buds pro 2, which it turned out I am totally allergic to and couldn't even wear for 10 minutes without getting a severe reaction, shame on you Samsung, they know they have a big problem and refused to return and refund me the buds.So here the journey starts, and shout out to Best Buy who took back and refunded every pair I bought! As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and  upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case,  the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me. So far I'm pretty pleased, for the price point and quality I would highly recommend them, also for those of you who are struggling with reactions to their earbuds, so far these have been great",5.0 out of 5 stars
soundcore by Anker Space A40 Auto-Adjustable Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"Final update - the right earbud issue has yet to repeat, so that's not an issue. As I've said, I have four other top end earbuds, and the only pair I use is the Soundcore A40. We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights. The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker by Anker,Soundcore,"I haven't had this speaker but for a couple of days. So far, I love this speaker. It's easy to set up and to pair. I love the app also. I can tell that this speaker is made with care. It's very durable and the sound is awesome. I can adjust the sound to what ever I prefer. For the money this is an awesome speaker for the low price and to me way better than other speakers of a bigger size. The battery last a long time around 12 to 14 hours of play time at medium volume. I got my speaker in a light blue which is perfect for me. The range is awesome. I can go several feet away from the source and it doesn't loose the bluetooth signal. This is small and fits just about anywhere I want to put it. It also has little legs on it so you can play it flat on a surface. It looks really nice and very durable. It's an awesome speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker by Anker,Soundcore,"I did a lot of research to find the most perfect mini speakers that would pair together and fit my pocket book price range. These were highly rated and so I took the Plunge...Boy, was I amazed at all the features- Functionally: super good sound, Perfect size and portability, relatively easy pairing (took a couple of times). These speakers are made solidly and I like the loop that allows attachment to a belt or to hang in a room for surround sound.Battery- Decided, like most electronics, to fully charge the pair before use- took approximately 1 hour for both. I have been playing this pair, moving around the house to test distance connectivity... 60 feet apart, both are without static interruption. One speaker in the bathroom and one in the dining room; one in the living room and one in the master bedroom- quality of music the same. Volume quality balance remains very good at 8/10 without irregularities in base or treble.After pairing, went to my Youtube music library on my iPhone, turned on my speed dial to Jazz, and WOW!!!!!!!For the price, these are almost 98% as good as my Bose speakers. They are lighter and worth every dollar, and can be placed anywhere in the house. See the pictures",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker by Anker,Soundcore,"This was an absolute elite gift for my son’s first birthday. I was shocked at how amazing this little speaker sounds. I have a 4 year old little JBL speaker and this one sounds better. I’ve found myself borrowing it for my workouts in the garage.As far as the speaker itself it’s lightweight, well built, and looks nice. The controls are responsive and nice. After charging it the first time it was extremely easy to pair with my devices, and I’ve had no issues with the Bluetooth. The battery lasts at least as long as promised, but seems like more to me.The app you can use with this is a nice feature. You can use custom equalizer settings, but I’ve found the standard one sounds great. You can also choose how long you want the speaker to remain idle before it turns off.If you’re interested in this for a baby or toddler: This is the perfect size for a little one. It is durable, waterproof, and the charging port is covered. From the first day my son received this he carried around the speaker wherever he went to play. He holds it up to me when he would like it turned on.When paired with an iPad you can set a maximum volume, so even if he did get to the volume buttons it’s completely safe and not too loud at the max. Before having this speaker my son would carry around Baby Einstein musical toys, and keep them going while he played. We usually play the baby Einstein playlists on Apple Music which he loves (and the songs sound MUCH better) but there’s other kids music too. The one feature that will take some time for my son to use is the skip because you have to press the play/pause button two times quickly. I’m sure that he will learn more quickly than I expect.I almost spent $140+ on a toddler music system that would have cost me $20 every time we wanted a new set of about 15 songs. Instead we have this awesome little speaker, a less expensive music subscription, and I get to use it too.Photo features average sized board book for scale.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker by Anker,Soundcore,"First off, I have read many reviews of this Sooundcore speaker before making my selection to purchase it. I seldom use a portable speaker but there are times when I do not want to use ear buds, headphones, or bone conduction haedphones.  I smoke/grill meat in the backyard a lot and I like to listen to some music while I am tending to the grill/smoker. I wanted a speaker that was tough, portable, waterproof/dustproof, but with good sound quality and battery life. The Soundcore Select 4 Go fit those needs.  I like the fact you can use the Soundcore app to use preset equalizer settings or customize your own. One little feature I like is I can power off the speaker through the app and I have used it a few times. Another feature the speaker has that I may or may not use is that you can pair another Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker to give you better sound.  However, remember this is a small portable speaker and has its limitations in sound quality and volume.  If you are wanting a speaker for a portable out door use this speaker is good for it.  However, if you wanting a portable speaker for playing party music at a large gathering indoor or outdoor then I would look into a better speaker which Soundcore also makes. I selected this model of Soundcore speaker model  because it met my needs size, battery life, sound quality and price.  This speaker is worth trying out and seeing if it fits your needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"Hi everyone! If you're on a budget and looking for good-quality earbuds, this review might be helpful for you.I bought these earbuds on October 27, 2023, and I’ve been using them consistently up until today, January 22, 2025.Sound QualityThe sound quality is good—very decent, especially considering the price. Remember, you're looking for affordable yet reliable earbuds, and these deliver on that front.DurabilityThe material is strong plastic. Within the first week, I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer (I forgot to take them out of my pocket). The charging lights stopped working for a couple of weeks but eventually came back to normal. That’s impressive durability! I’ve also dropped them almost daily, and they don’t even have a crack. Bonus points for durability because I work in building maintenance, and they’ve been in my pocket with screws, utility knives, and other tools—they’ve held up really well.ComfortThey’re not the most comfortable earbuds out there. After about 4 hours of use, my ears do start to hurt, but you get used to it over time. If you bend over, they’re likely to slip out of your ears. You can feel them sliding, so you have time to catch them before they fall. To be fair, this happens with pricier earbuds like AirPods, too.Battery LifeThis is by far my favorite feature. Even after washing them, the battery continues to perform great. I charge them every 3 days, and I use them for at least 4 hours a day. I’ve tried other earbuds like JBL and AirPods, but their battery life doesn’t compare to these. The battery is the main reason I’ve stuck with these ""bad boys.""Final ThoughtsI highly recommend these earbuds if you’re looking for something affordable, durable, and with excellent battery life. Thanks for reading—if anyone actually read all of this!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"I've had these for well over a year now and I can honestly say after trying about 5 other brands (known brands, including Apples Air Pods) that these are by far my favorite ear buds for every day use.I usually have these in for 3-4 hours a day. I have to charge the case once every 2 weeks  or so at that rate so no complaints about the battery. I've worn them for a full 8 hour car trip once & the batteries in the buds themselves had plenty of life left after that span.They're light & comfortable. I've never had ear discomfort eveb when keeping them in for hours at a time. At times they will slide out but I have that issue with all ear buds. These stay in better than any other buds I've tried.The sound on these for the price point is great. You're obviously not getting insane studio quality sound with these but you're definitely getting a much fuller sound than others at this price point. The buds do have a touch control EQ for people who prefer on the fly adjustment. Personally I would've preferred touch volume controls over EQ. (I rarely use the EQ function).My only small complaint is the microphone on these isn't great. For phone calls it isn't terrible but if you're recording audio for any purpose it is noticeably muffled & lacks noise reduction.Aside from that I don't think you can go wrong with these if you're just looking for a high quality pair of everyday headphones.*I did have an issue with the bass blowing out in one of my ear buds (caused by volume accidentally being turned all the way up really fast). But they do have a warranty & Anker had a new pair sent out within a few days. It was one of the easiest and best customer experiences I've ever had. I would order from the company again just based on that experience.In general the products I've purchased from Anker have always exceeded my expectations and these ear buds definitely fit that level of quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Soundcore by Anker Life P2 Mini True Wireless Earbuds,Soundcore,"At this point everyone in my family has one of these.After trying multiple brands over the years ever since the pandemic made school classes remote from home back in 2020 I’ve been buying up earphones for my two kids to use; even when they went back to school classes in-person it was requested that everyone have a set for classroom use.My oldest (17) swears by Soundcore and had the Lifenote E before these, and now has a pair of this at home and a pair that travels to school with him. My youngest (11) has now ordered a set for the home computer and one for school as well. Hubbby finally caved and got himself a set too.They talk about comfort in the ear, sound quality at distances from the device playing audio, and long battery life.

TOZO Wireless Earbuds Build in Mic Clear Calls Ergonomic Light Weight Bluetooth 5.3 in Ear Headphones Waterproof Premium Stereo Sound Ear Buds 30H Playtime with 32 EQs via APP,Tozo,"After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore.

TOZO Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones Premium Sound Performance Touch Control LED Digital Display Wireless Charging Case Earphones Black,Tozo,"After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore. But I do hear my bones rattling around now. I can't fix that. If you are experiencing this I think the foam tips can fix that. No need to buy an expensive pair.

TOZO T10 Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones,Tozo,"I don’t usually write reviews. But after over a year with the TOZO T10s, I feel like I owe them a love letter.I used to own AirPods. And then I lost them. Then I replaced them. And lost them again. Repeat that cycle more times than I’d like to admit—until one day, I’d had enough. I wanted earbuds I could trust to stay in my ears, stay with me through a chaotic student schedule, and not cost half a paycheck to replace.That’s when I stumbled across the TOZO T10s. I didn’t expect much, honestly—just something functional. But what I got was a full-on game changer.These have become my go-to earbuds for everything. I’m a full-time student, which means I’m constantly switching between reading, running to class, zoning out to music, or escaping into a podcast while doing dishes or walking to the library. I needed earbuds that could keep up with me—and these do. They’re comfortable, snug, and stay in place no matter what I’m doing. Whether I’m on a packed train, on a long flight, or trying not to disturb my roommate during a late-night study session, the sound quality is consistently clear, rich, and immersive. Like, weirdly good for the price.I’ve taken them to the beach, I’ve worn them in the rain, I’ve accidentally dropped them in coffee once (don’t ask)—and they kept going. The waterproofing is not just a gimmick; it’s saved me multiple times.The battery life? Unreal. I charge them maybe once every two weeks, and that’s with daily use. It’s one less thing to stress about, and for me, that alone makes them worth it.Now here’s where the story gets even better.After over a year of near-daily use, my left earbud started acting up. Not totally dead, just inconsistent. I figured, “Well, I’ve definitely gotten my money’s worth—time to buy another pair.” But I decided to shoot TOZO an email, just in case. One single email. No hassle, no waiting on hold, no weird hoops to jump through. They responded almost immediately, and within a few days, they shipped me a replacement. Just like that.In a world where companies make you feel like a number or a nuisance, TOZO treated me like a human being. That kind of customer service and product support is rare—and it made me a loyal fan for life.If you’re looking for earbuds that punch way above their price tag, survive the unpredictable chaos of daily life, and come with a company that actually cares—the TOZO T10s are it.I don’t miss my AirPods. Not even a little.",5.0 out of 5 stars
TOZO T10 Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones,Tozo,"I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this ""review"" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Redmi Buds 6 Lite,Xiaomi,"The Redmi Buds 6 lite are a great low-cost option for wireless BT headphones with decent audio and solid microphone quality, including microphone background noise cancellation (for voice/input audio).

The folks on reddit were right--with redmi buds lite I have no complaints! =) I can't comment on durability yet as I've only had them 2-3 months, but the case battery life seems great because I've only charged the case once.

Redmi Buds 6 Lite,Xiaomi,"I'm not an audiophile, I also don't tend to purchase super expensive audio equipment. I just want decent bass and clear audio for listening to music/youtube videos and making calls,On both sides it's much better than the previous ones I've used around the same price from anker and even other redmi earbuds I bought a few years ago.The ANC isn't super impressive (see the price and lower your expectations); it's good enough for low level bassy sounds like machinery humming but high pitched, sudden, or sharp sounds pass through pretty easily.The transparency mode is actually very good. It presents external audio clearer than just having transparency mode off so if you need to hear occasional external sounds while listening to your music it's pretty good for that.Comfort is good for wearing all day in my experience.

XIAOMI Redmi Buds 6 Pro,Xiaomi,"Don't get me wrong, I purchased them at a big discount and I've absolutely love them they have better Active Noise Cancellation (and sound better too) than my Airpods pro 2 and it's not even close, it's amazing, like has better ANC than some of them that are double the price or more. love the Bluetooth LDAC codec, I've had no problems with connection even when forcing them at (priorize best quality at 990khz setting) battery life is ok, nothing to complain about,  the fast charging is great, the case itself feels premium and love the light bar battery indicator.My only problem with them is maybe the multipoint feature, it trips a little between devices when popping them out of the case and sometimes disconnect from the device I want to hear music (in that case is my phone most of the time) so I have to manually connect them again as a regular Bluetooth device, this is rare tho, like just 5-10% and another thing to mention is when using multipoint battery drains faster but not significantly faster, but other than that, the multipoint feature works great.Recommended, I'd probably go for this over the NC 4 liberty if similar price, it absolutely worths the price (plus in my opinion they look prettier than the NC).If cheaper, it's a no-brainer",4.0 out of 5 stars

XIAOMI TWSEJ04LS Redmi Airdots Earphones,Xiaomi,¡Excelente!,5.0 out of 5 stars
XIAOMI TWSEJ04LS Redmi Airdots Earphones,Xiaomi,"Like I assume many others have, I looked at this product as a cheaper alternative to the Apple AirPods. To be entirely honest, I was expecting mediocre sound quality and battery life. I turned out to be delightfully surprised by how much I like these earphones.The sound quality is very clear, perhaps not ""audiophile"" tier, but let's be honest: no earphones are audiophile quality at $30. I've heard people complain about latency when watching videos. I personally haven't experienced that. Whenever I watch a YouTube video, I don't notice any latency, though I suppose that I could be not as sensitive to that as other people.  The battery life is also pretty decent (not mind-blowing, but solid).  The Bluetooth is easy to set up as per the included instruction booklet; pairing them with my iPhone 6s was a cinch.They are comfortable to wear. I'm usually not a fan of the squishy rubber found in a lot of earphones—I usually wear over-the-ear headphones or hard plastic ones—but for some reason, I think these earphones are comfortable. Differently sized rubber pieces are included, in case you prefer a larger or smaller size.The only gripe I have with this product is that no charging cable was included. I mean, Micro USB cords are ubiquitous enough, so it's not egregious.",5.0 out of 5 stars
XIAOMI TWSEJ04LS Redmi Airdots Earphones,Xiaomi,"*Third revision* getting the headphones to pair to each other was a bit of a nuisance and the left bud seems to have some connection issues as far as the charging case is concerned. Once paired successfully, they function great as headphones, and the sound cancelling is great. The fit is also very nice. So aside from the pairing/charging issues I've come across in my short time I find them to be pretty good. *update* I've used the buds for the last day and have been able to discern where the problems lie. The connection issue is solved pretty simply by turning the left bud off and on again, and when I looked closer at the charging case I noticed that the prongs in the left compartment were considerable shorter than the right ones and one of them was even half stuck under the plastic! This rendered the left bud unchargeable because it couldn't complete the connection. *new* used a thumbtack to gently pry the stuck prong out and all has been well for the last few days of continued use. I will say that, as someone with smaller ears, the fit, though quite snug, became uncomfortable after prolonged usage (more than an hour and a half). 4 stars because of the initial pairing/charging issues",4.0 out of 5 stars
XIAOMI TWSEJ04LS Redmi Airdots Earphones,Xiaomi,"I absolutely love these ear buds. For the price they are really nice. I watch you tube, listen to Spotify and the sound quality is wonderful.

XIAOMI TWSEJ04LS Redmi Airdots Earphones,Xiaomi,I ordered two sets. I was very happy with one pair as the sound quality and battery life were very good and they are comfortable to wear.

Even the start-up sounds crackle. Really annoying too, because I need the charging case because I lost my other pair's... but it also has a bad connection to the pins.

Xiaomi Wireless Earbuds Redmi Buds 3 Lite,Xiaomi,My dog has a habit of destroying my earbuds.  I've been buying redmi for years due to their high quality for the price.  However these have been incredibly frustrating to use.  I've been through two sets and both of them have charging issues.  I'm not trying a third.  I will just move on to a different brand.  The issue seems to be the case.  It lights up when charging but often will stop charging almost immediately.  Even if the ear buds and case are dead as a doornail.

Xiaomi Redmi Buds Essential Wireless Earbuds M2222E1,Xiaomi,"these are more convenient to use and fit more comfortably in my ears than Airpods. I mean, that's subjective since they might fit your weird-ass ears differently. Battery lasts forever. Easy to charge. And because they're so cheap, it's not a big deal if you lose them, like every time I lost my $100 airpods because all apple products are designed to slip out of your pocket and into a crack in a couch or something (iphones, appletv remote, mac mini, etc). As for the quality, i'm not an audiophile and was born without the ability to appreciate or connect with music, so maybe I'm not the best guy to consult. But I can say that they sound great to me. If you're some nasty freak who walks around going ""oh my lows, oooh my mids, ooooh my tweeters!"" then you're probably already looking for your airpod pros in your loveseat. I think the durability is high quality even though they feel like toys. I've dropped them a million times and they still work.",5.0 out of 5 stars

XIAOMI Redmi Buds 4 Active,Xiaomi,"I recently purchased the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active and I’m absolutely impressed with them. For the price, they deliver exceptional sound quality, comfort, and functionality that I didn’t expect at this price point.Sound Quality:The 12mm dynamic driver produces clear, balanced sound with deep bass and crisp treble. Whether I’m listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the sound quality is rich and immersive. The audio is loud enough to block out background noise, but still clear and precise, which is great for workouts or commuting.Bluetooth Connectivity:The Bluetooth® 5.3 connection is super stable and ensures there are no drops or interruptions, even when I’m walking around or moving my head. The connection pairs quickly and smoothly with my phone and other Bluetooth devices. The Google Fast Pair feature is a convenient addition, allowing me to connect the buds to my phone instantly.Battery Life:The 28 hours of listening time with the case is impressive. Even after long listening sessions, I don’t need to worry about charging them constantly. I can go through an entire workday or long trips without having to charge them, and when they do need a charge, it’s quick and easy with the compact case.Comfort & Fit:The buds are lightweight and fit comfortably in my ears. They don’t feel heavy or bulky, and they stay securely in place even when I’m on the move. I can wear them for hours without discomfort, which is important for my long listening sessions or calls.Design:The Graphite Black color is sleek and modern, with a nice matte finish. The case is compact, making it easy to throw into my pocket or bag without taking up too much space. The overall design feels premium, especially considering the price.Conclusion:Overall, the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active are a fantastic choice if you’re looking for affordable yet high-quality earbuds. The sound quality, Bluetooth connection, and long battery life make them an excellent value. If you're looking for reliable wireless earbuds for everyday use, I highly recommend these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Bluetooth 5.3 connection is super stable, and I’ve had no issues with connectivity or dropouts.The fit is incredibly comfortable. The earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and snug fit for different ear shapes. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, and the noise isolation is great, blocking out most external sounds, which enhances the listening experience even more.The battery life is impressive as well. I’ve been able to use them for several hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides plenty of additional power for multiple uses. The touch controls are responsive and make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls without having to pull out my phone.Overall, these earbuds are an incredible value for the price.

XIAOMI OpenWear Stereo Hi-Res LHDC Earbuds,Xiaomi,"These Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Hi-Res LHDC Earbuds are comfortable to wear, and the sound is pretty good...but for several reasons, I was torn between giving them three stars or four.  I'm going to preface my review by mentioning that I'm using them with a Xiaomi phone (13T Pro) because the experience of pairing and using them will likely be different on non-Xiaomi devices and because Xiaomi phones have a following here but aren't widely used in the United States.As soon as I opened the charger case and took out the headphones they were recognized by my phone and a pop-up menu came on my display to pair them.  I didn't need to go into the Bluetooth menu or Bluetooth Pairing Mode first, but that's almost certainly because I'm already using a Xiaomi phone.The pop-up menu may suggest that you go to the Play Store to download the Xiaomi Headphones App.  A bar code for the app is also included in the packaging of the headphones.  The problem if you live in the United States is that the Xiaomi Headphones App is indeed available in the Play Store, but not for download here.  You can download the Android app directly from Xiaomi's website in Taiwan or likely find it on an APK Site, although downloading it directly from Xiaomi is probably the safer choice.If you already own a Xiaomi smartphone running HyperOS, then you don't need the app because all of the menu options available in the app are baked directly into HyperOS.  If you go into the list of paired Bluetooth devices on your phone and click the right arrow a menu with headphone options  (see pics) comes up that's identical to the interface from the separate headphones app.You can specify what happens when you single, double, and long press the right and left earbuds, choose between using AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs (more on that particular setting in a moment--but if you read no further, NEVER USE THE AAC BLUETOOTH CODEC ON  AN ANDROID DEVICE), and manually enable the ANC which does very little on my phone--possibly because it isn't compatible with the AI Features in HyperOS.  I can tell when ANC is turned on and off, but it has so little practical effect in terms of reducing ambient noise that activating it is pointless.  In the menu options ANC shows up under Laboratory  Functions as Comfort and noise reduction and needs to be manually enabled every time you connect the headphones.  Since this is a Laboratory Function, that probably means it's either experimental or still in active development.  The other possible reason it's not part of the main controls may be that the ANC works better on some devices than others, since it's a function that relies heavily on AI to work.To be fair to Xiaomi---the ANC in Bluetooth headphones from Bose, Sony, and Samsung also relies on AI to work, unlike older wired headphones, where the ANC functioning was completely hardware-based and built into the physical body of the headphones themselves.  Bluetooth ANC headphones often require an app and attempt to leverage the AI Capabilities built into your smartphone CPU to do most of the noise-cancelling heavy lifting.Earbuds don't offer sound quality comparable to over-the-ear headphones at the same price point, but you're sacrificing great sound for convenience and portability.  As far as earbuds go, these Xiaomi OpenEar sound quite good with nice definition and a balanced range that keeps trebly music from sounding shrill or bass-heavy music from sounding muddy.  I own earbuds from Skull Candy, Sony, Xiaomi (from their cheaper Redmi line), and Zipforce and these easily sound the best.I also appreciate the ear hooks because I have trouble with fit and comfort with some earbuds.  These stay in place over the ear, and I don't have to worry about them popping out and losing one or both.  Since they sit just outside of the ear, wearing them causes no discomfort or ear irritation over extended periods of use--problems that I often encounter with in-ear style earbuds.So if these sound good and are comfortable, why was I strongly tempted to give them three stars instead of four?The gesture commands don't work as well as they should.  Using a single tap to raise or lower volume is fine although I wish a single tap didn't change the volume quite so much--but the double tap commands to stop and restart music don't work reliably to the point where I've given up on even trying to use them--if I'm at a register or in another situation where I would normally want to pause music I turn down the volume instead because turning down the volume actually works.  Using the double tap on either earbud more often than not gets registered as two separate taps to change the volume or as a single long tap to access Google Assistant (Gemini) but since accessing the assistant makes it ready to listen, I didn't realize that the assistant on my phone was being activated.While the ANC does little on my phone call quality is good even in noisy environments and people at the other end of calls can always seem to hear me so there is some kind of noise cancelling going on with phone calls that does work well.Now a quick warning about AAC:In the Audio Menu for the headphones under Audio Quality you can choose between AAC which is listed as High Quality and SBC which is listed as Standard Quality.  That's not an accurate description on Android.  SBC has been capable of high definition sound since Bluetooth 5.0 and AAC is an Apple Bluetooth codec that works very poorly on Android devices.  Even if you're listening to a music source with the AAC Audio Codec you shouldn't use the AAC Bluetooth codec thinking that it passes through the sound.  Despite sharing the same name the AAC Audio Codec and Bluetooth codec are two separate things.  The AAC audio codec is capable of reproducing full CD-quality sound.  The AAC Bluetooth codec is not.  The AAC Bluetooth Codec re-encodes audio rather than passing it through even on Apple devices.The menu toggle for the headphones allowed me to switch between AAC and SBC on the fly while listening to songs.  With a lot of music, you can barely tell any difference between the two.  But with songs that are difficult to reproduce because there are multiple instruments playing simultaneously or music that uses reverb to create atmosphere and space the AAC Bluetooth Codec cuts off audio frequencies well within the range of normal human hearing.  Sound is clipped and songs have noticeably less range.Final Verdict:  If having effective ANC is an important feature, then I definitely can't recommend the Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Hi-Res LHDC Earbuds.  The tap gestures beyond single taps to change volume also work poorly.  But these are very comfortable to wear, they sound nice, and if you're using a Xiaomi phone running HyperOS, all of the headphone controls from the separate headphones app are baked right into the OS.  For me, these were worth the money, but they may not be the best choice for everyone--especially in the United States, where Xiaomi phones aren't that widely used.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Xiaomi Portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker Sound Pocket,Xiaomi,"This Xiaomi Mini has easily the best sound of any compact Bluetooth speaker I've used.  Sound is clear and balanced, and also surprisingly full for a speaker this size.  My tastes run towards new wave and power pop, and this speaker does a nice job with delicate acoustic guitar, plucked strings, and percussive synth notes, preserving the character of the music without allowing the individual instruments to blend into mush, which is what usually happens with speakers this small.Some people may not be satisfied with the level of bass--but the only way to deliver thumping bass without making the overall sound muddy is to have a woofer or sub-woofer separate from the main speaker reproducing the bulk of the instruments.  A speaker this size can deliver heavy bass or it can deliver a balanced sound, but it can't do both--for most music, balanced sound is far preferable.You can also answer phone calls with this speaker, but that's not something that I tested or have any interest in.With an IP 67 rating, this speaker can get wet without being damaged (which is why the product image shows splashing water surrounding the speaker).  The rating means the speaker can be submerged in water for 30 minutes, which is something else that I didn't personally test and really wouldn't recommend.  I did test water contact in the shower, and the speaker held up fine to that.Final Verdict:  For the price and size, this is a pretty amazing speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It’s such a great portable speaker, I just bought a second one to take advantage of the stereo pairing option. Sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker.

Long story short, with simple tools I was able to open it up, repair the damage, and put it back together.It’d be perfect if it had USB-C playback —or even a 3.5mm jack, but I don’t see why the whole thing can be hacked once the battery dies.",5.0 out of 5 stars

XIAOMI Redmi Watch 5 Active Smartwatch,Xiaomi,"Great smartwatch for the price! The screen is bright and clear, the battery lasts days, and it’s very comfortable to wear. Tracks steps, sleep, and workouts accurately. Simple, fast, and perfect for everyday use. Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
XIAOMI Redmi Watch 5 Active Smartwatch,Xiaomi,"I’ve always been a fan of Xiaomi products — I actually had two of their phones back before they became really popular. I don’t currently have one, but I might go back to Xiaomi after this experience. The Redmi Watch 5 is a nice and simple smartwatch for the price — you really can’t expect premium features when it’s not even $100, but it definitely holds its own.It does take a little time to get used to, especially figuring out how to unlock it, navigate the features, and connect it to the app on your phone. But once you get it set up, it works well and does what it’s supposed to. Overall, it’s a good, reliable watch for everyday use.",5.0 out of 5 stars

XIAOMI Redmi Watch 5 Active Smartwatch,Xiaomi,"The watch itself is very nice,  good size, battery life and features.  What I don't like is how or why I cannot get it to stop receiving my calls.  All of my phone calls while i m in and outside my car always default to going to this watch.  I have made some many changes but none worked.  My first option would be the car's audio,  and if i m not in the car,  I like using my speaker phone to talk.  But everything goes to the watch.  Even on my phone,  I would try to switch over to speaker phone,  car's audio,  but it wont' let me.",4.0 out of 5 stars

XIAOMI Redmi Buds 4 Lite TWS Wireless Earbuds,Xiaomi,"I like the sound quality, the build of the earbuds, and the compact size of the case—it takes up very little space in my pockets.My only issues with the earbuds are that they can be quite uncomfortable (to be fair, I have small ears), and when traveling (windows down) or in a noisy area, the sound gets completely drowned out, which isn’t a huge deal because I'm mostly home. Other than that, it's a great find! I can't really complain too much.",4.0 out of 5 stars
