        "review": "This is my second pair of Sound Core earbuds. My first set lasted me for several years and I still use them, but thought I would have a second pair on hand just in case they fail. They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

The sound quality is also surprisingly acceptable.I have not had these on long enough to test out battery life or what not. I use this for workouts, so no more than an hr or so of actual use a day.I hate the touch controls, so had to turn it off using the app. Thankfully they let you turn all of the touch controls via the app, plus turn off the noise\\ping you hear when you brush up against the touch control....So this is as basic of use as you can get, which I look for in headphones.I am sick of haptic controls, touch controls, over-reliance of the accompanying app, and active noise cancelling features. All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage. Give me a headphone that does 1 thing, and make sure it has a hardware switch on it, and no press-to-hold power switch.The industry is bloated with trash so-called smart headphones. rant over.",

The batteries on the earpieces and the case last longer than you\u2019d think as well.

        "review": "This is my second pair of Sound Core earbuds. My first set lasted me for several years and I still use them, but thought I would have a second pair on hand just in case they fail. They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage.

They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

The battery life is also astonishing. They fit perfectly in my ears, and very comfortably. I love the color options they have available. You can customize your sound and the controls on their app. Only complaint is that they don\u2019t have ANC, although in my experience my music already cancelled everything out.",

My wife has a set of wireless earbuds from that \u201cfruit\u201d company and these blow those completely out of the water and for a fraction of the price.The are extremely clear and have great bass. The batteries on the earpieces and the case last longer than you\u2019d think as well. The controls on the earpieces are very functional and I found them incredibly useful after I figured them out.Before you go out and spend big on earbuds, give these a try!",

        "review": "I bought these earbuds primarily out of curiosity to see how the \"AI live translation\" feature worked. Overall, the earbuds themselves aren't bad, but the software that powers them leaves a lot to be desired.*The AI translation feature is present in a dedicated app menu, but the page or tab simply doesn't work at all after selecting the mode and languages.*The app itself demands many different permissions, including your location, microphone, and nearby devices. While microphone and nearby device access can somewhat be explained, sharing your location makes absolutely no sense, yet the app won't proceed without it. This prevents you from adjusting the sound mixer or even attempting to use the non-functional AI translation.*Noise cancellation works, but if there's any wind, you'll experience light clicking or crackling in your ear.*The earbuds come with additional eartip sizes. With the medium-sized tips, the earbuds shift around in my ears while walking, creating strange clicking noises. With the large tips, the earbuds simply fall out of my ears after 5-8 minutes of walking.For this price, not worth right now. In theory, for around $50-60, they'd be decent earbuds, as the material quality and sound are not bad at all.",

They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200).

The battery life is also astonishing. They fit perfectly in my ears, and very comfortably. I love the color options they have available. You can customize your sound and the controls on their app. Only complaint is that they don\u2019t have ANC, although in my experience my music already cancelled everything out.",

I also have four sets of Apple earbuds that are pretty much worthless.  Each set has one nonworking earbud and the other earbud doesn't keep a good charge.  Soundcore earbuds are comfortable as I wear them in bed listening to Audible.",

My wife has a set of wireless earbuds from that \u201cfruit\u201d company and these blow those completely out of the water and for a fraction of the price.The are extremely clear and have great bass. The batteries on the earpieces and the case last longer than you\u2019d think as well. The controls on the earpieces are very functional and I found them incredibly useful after I figured them out.Before you go out and spend big on earbuds, give these a try!",
