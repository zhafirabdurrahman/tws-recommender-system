        "review": "Have you ever felt the gut rumbling (sub) bass?  As in with a few 18\" subwoofers going low and everything just rumble?  Now imagine hearing the same bass but without feeling it.  It's quite surreal and surreal is the best way to describe it when you are wearing this item and it hits the low bass.  You just don't feel it in your gut.  So revelation no. 1, yes, you can hear low bass, and no. 2, the BP1 Pro is pretty good.The item came nicely packaged, unlike the many cheap imports in plain plastic bags or cardboard boxes, it has a properly printed box with Hi-Res Audio (Wireless) label displayed prominently.  In addition, there is a bass label, too.  Never seen that before.  It also displays 55-hours battery life, -50dB adaptive hybrid ANC (active noise cancellation), IP55 splash resistant.  All very good characteristics for a set of true wireless in-ear earbuds.  And let's not forget the obligatory AI product association with 6-mic AI clear calls.  This item simply check all the boxes.  And that's just what's printed on the box!  The many functions aside, it also meets all the certifications as well, according to all the certification labels on the box, not to mention recycling directions.  All in multiple languages.  In fine print, it also boasts 58ms dual channel ultra low latency,  Something about bass boost and treble balance \"tuned by Baseus App\".  I might have to look into that but, spoiler alert, it already sounds very good.  It shows 10 minutes rapid recharge for 2-5 hours of play time and can seamlessly connect to two different devices.  Then there's a symbol for not including an AC adapter, and another that indicates it will support 2-5W chargers.  Inside the box, you will find the charging case with the ear buds in them, extra sets of ear tips for different ear cannel sizing, and an USB-A to USB-C charge cord.  True to advertisement, charging was indeed fast using a higher powered USB-C charger.  It went from pulsating green to solid green in no time to which I interpret as being fully charged.  Opening the lid starts the pairing process and putting them in your ear you can hear your paired device audio output.  They fit perfectly in my ears out of the box and are quite comfortable with the included tips.  Don't even have to swap tips, bonus!  And I already raved about the bass that it can hit low.  The treble is good, too, not shrilly, but very pleasant.  The mids aren't forward but not too laid back either.  So far with the music I've tried, it's at least a b+ tier sound to my ears, easily beat the Air Pod Pro and even possibly be on par with the Moon Drop Space Travel.  More comparisons will be necessary and I'll update with any further discoveries.  The build quality and material used also means it will be quite durable.I chose to pair it with my Android phone running current up to date version with Developer Mode enabled.  It even displays its name properly (unlike many cheap devices that use weird names).  Even with Developer mode enabled, however, LDAC CODEC option is still grayed out.  Sad face.  I thought I saw somewhere in the description that it had LDAC support.  I'll have to check with one of the AI models and see if it can be un-grayed out.  Maybe download the app will help.",

        "review": "First ImpressionsThis initial review is mostly for sound only. I am referencing these to my Technics AZ Series, which to this day, by far, the best sounding, clearest, most enjoyable tws earbuds I have come across. This goes for soundstage, depth, clarity across ranges, and what I consider faithfulness in sound reproduction, what Dre refers to as how the music is meant to be heard. Only the Technics has been able to shine across all these dimensions, coming from a horn, drums, percussion, and guitar player.That said, against this reference the BP1s in Noise Cancelling mode holds its own against my Technics in sound clarity, particularly with the bass as oft mentioned, and the highs which are close, but noticeably not par. Fades, sizzles, done right. This is impressive for the price, a mere fraction of what the Technics is at. Also the battery life is much, much better. Much less range anxiety.LDAC needs to be vetted more, particularly with an LDAC supported source, one of my fav being the Quad DAC LG G series, if you can find one that works. The music on those devices are legendary, on par with Technics, but LG never has been recognized for it. I anticipate the LDAC being impressive also, but once again not on par with something like a reference bud, although with the right app and settings I'm absolutely certain it can match it. Based on what I'm hearing as I'm typing, the Baseus BP1 has what it takes to reach that level, it just needs the right help.I'll add to this once I get to play with the settings more, as I'm not a fan of downloading apps just to control the sound or use. Hasn't been used on calls, not sure I want to. There's dedicated buds for that. I haven't submerged these in water yet either. And the tips haven't been fully optimized. I'm trying not to use the Spinfits I have even though they have solid collars. They cause itchiness and discomfort, unlike their mainland counterparts. That said, word to Floss, the BP1s are a \"major, major, major GO.\"",

They connected right away and the app makes the biggest difference with pretty much any earbuds these days and this one's no different. You can adjust anything and everything from the app making these sound absolutely incredible for the price. I would have thought these were $50+ just listening to them then seeing all the adjustments as well makes these a steal. They fit great, sound great, and the battery lasts forever as well.If you're on the fence, jump down and buy these now!Also, I want to give a shout out to their customer service for being absolutely top notch.

Only the Technics has been able to shine across all these dimensions, coming from a horn, drums, percussion, and guitar player.That said, against this reference the BP1s in Noise Cancelling mode holds its own against my Technics in sound clarity, particularly with the bass as oft mentioned, and the highs which are close, but noticeably not par. Fades, sizzles, done right. This is impressive for the price, a mere fraction of what the Technics is at. Also the battery life is much, much better. Much less range anxiety.LDAC needs to be vetted more, particularly with an LDAC supported source, one of my fav being the Quad DAC LG G series, if you can find one that works. The music on those devices are legendary, on par with Technics, but LG never has been recognized for it.

        "review": "I've been using the E20 True Wireless Earbuds for a few weeks now, so I feel comfortable sharing my thoughts on them. I've used them while commuting, working out, relaxing at home, and even taking calls while doing other things. The earbuds connected to my phone in a matter of seconds and were ready to use. I didn't have to set them up again after that. Now, every time I take them out of the case, they connect right away. I thought they were comfortable in my ears when I put them on. They stayed in place for hours without causing any pain or pressure. The sound was rich and balanced, and the bass added depth without drowning out the rest of the track. I also use them a lot to watch videos, and the clarity makes it easy to understand what people are saying. I got many calls while I was cooking or walking the dog, and the person on the other end could hear me without me having to repeat myself. The battery life surprised me as well; I only had to charge the case every now and then because each listening session was so long. The fact that they are water-resistant makes me feel better about using them in more active situations. Despite frequent use in pockets, bags, and the charging case, they maintained their original appearance and functionality. The E20 earbuds have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, sound quality, and battery life after using them every day for the past few weeks. Whether I'm at home, at the gym, or out running errands, they are now a simple and dependable part of my daily routine. They can be used for almost any activity because they have a long battery life, a stable connection, and clear sound.",

        "review": "I have long been a fan of the quality delivered by this manufacturer at an affordable price. When given the opportunity to take the E20 for a spin, I jumped at it!  No surprise, these are AMAZING for their price point of $19.99 (at time of review). As advertised, the bass is deep and vibrant. The mid-tones are good and the high-notes are not at all \"tinny\".  I find the stereo to be well balanced though the \"sound stage\" is definitely on the flat side - but, for $20, one cannot expect 7.1 surround sound. The fit is great out of the box and pairing to my phone was a breeze. With a full charge and some pep in my step I set out the door for a quick run and found that the volume levels are acceptable for exercise and that I could safely hear approaching traffic WITH noise canceling turned on or off. Voices on audiobooks/podcasts were clear and distinguishable while my '80s playlist rocked right around the block.  For $20, the fact it includes ANY level of noise cancellation is shocking so, being that its effect is a bit weak isn't a huge surprise or disappointment.  Operation is simple, with single, double and triple taps on either ear doing the job of answering calls or controlling music/chapters.  The charging case, as always, handles like a wet bar of soap but the buds pop right in and return to a full charge FAST.  Due to their solid sound, easy pairing and operation and PHENOMENAL price point, I give these a FULL recommendation and highly suggest these as gifts for ANY gift exchange with a price limit of $20!",

The earbuds sit nicely in her ears without feeling bulky, so she can wear them for a while without discomfort. She mainly uses them for music, watching videos on her phone, and sometimes taking short calls.The sound quality surprised her, especially the bass, which gives music a fuller feel without overpowering the vocals. Connection has been steady, even as she moves around the house, and she hasn't had any issues with pairing or random dropouts. Battery life has also been more than enough for her daily use, she can go several days before needing a recharge. They've  become part of her daily routine, and she's been enjoying having a lightweight , reliable pair of earbuds that are easy to use and comfortable for long listening sessions.",

        "review": "I've been using the E20 True Wireless Earbuds for a few weeks now, so I feel comfortable sharing my thoughts on them. I've used them while commuting, working out, relaxing at home, and even taking calls while doing other things. The earbuds connected to my phone in a matter of seconds and were ready to use. I didn't have to set them up again after that. Now, every time I take them out of the case, they connect right away. I thought they were comfortable in my ears when I put them on. They stayed in place for hours without causing any pain or pressure. The sound was rich and balanced, and the bass added depth without drowning out the rest of the track. I also use them a lot to watch videos, and the clarity makes it easy to understand what people are saying. I got many calls while I was cooking or walking the dog, and the person on the other end could hear me without me having to repeat myself. The battery life surprised me as well; I only had to charge the case every now and then because each listening session was so long. The fact that they are water-resistant makes me feel better about using them in more active situations. Despite frequent use in pockets, bags, and the charging case, they maintained their original appearance and functionality. The E20 earbuds have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, sound quality, and battery life after using them every day for the past few weeks. Whether I'm at home, at the gym, or out running errands, they are now a simple and dependable part of my daily routine. They can be used for almost any activity because they have a long battery life, a stable connection, and clear sound.",

        "review": "I have long been a fan of the quality delivered by this manufacturer at an affordable price. When given the opportunity to take the E20 for a spin, I jumped at it!  No surprise, these are AMAZING for their price point of $19.99 (at time of review). As advertised, the bass is deep and vibrant. The mid-tones are good and the high-notes are not at all \"tinny\".  I find the stereo to be well balanced though the \"sound stage\" is definitely on the flat side - but, for $20, one cannot expect 7.1 surround sound. The fit is great out of the box and pairing to my phone was a breeze. With a full charge and some pep in my step I set out the door for a quick run and found that the volume levels are acceptable for exercise and that I could safely hear approaching traffic WITH noise canceling turned on or off. Voices on audiobooks/podcasts were clear and distinguishable while my '80s playlist rocked right around the block.  For $20, the fact it includes ANY level of noise cancellation is shocking so, being that its effect is a bit weak isn't a huge surprise or disappointment.  Operation is simple, with single, double and triple taps on either ear doing the job of answering calls or controlling music/chapters.  The charging case, as always, handles like a wet bar of soap but the buds pop right in and return to a full charge FAST.  Due to their solid sound, easy pairing and operation and PHENOMENAL price point, I give these a FULL recommendation and highly suggest these as gifts for ANY gift exchange with a price limit of $20!",

The right one is fine though.EQ mode - If you are using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings, the only EQ mode you can use is \"Baseus Classic\" . If you attempt to switch to another EQ setting, it turns off Spatial Acoustics, which degrades both the volume level and sound quality.The Spatial Acoustics settings actually sound pretty good, but no EQ customization is possible. Personally I prefer the Cinema setting as it is a little less harsh in the high end.Bass Boost - there are five levels to choose from, but none of them have any noticeable effect on the sound.The stock EQ mode settings are OK, but there isn't much difference between them, and you cannot actually see a graph of which frequencies are boost/cut for each.The customizable EQ is shockingly bad. No matter what you do, I will bet money that you cannot make it sound even halfway decent.  Sounds like AM radio to me. Completely worthless to the user.The charge indicator light on the case is pretty useless. There is no readout of battery level, just a single LED indicator that changes color depending on charge level. The highest level indicator - green - means the battery level is between 40% and 100%.

        "review": "Have you ever felt the gut rumbling (sub) bass?  As in with a few 18\" subwoofers going low and everything just rumble?  Now imagine hearing the same bass but without feeling it.  It's quite surreal and surreal is the best way to describe it when you are wearing this item and it hits the low bass.  You just don't feel it in your gut.  So revelation no. 1, yes, you can hear low bass, and no. 2, the BP1 Pro is pretty good.The item came nicely packaged, unlike the many cheap imports in plain plastic bags or cardboard boxes, it has a properly printed box with Hi-Res Audio (Wireless) label displayed prominently.  In addition, there is a bass label, too.  Never seen that before.  It also displays 55-hours battery life, -50dB adaptive hybrid ANC (active noise cancellation), IP55 splash resistant.  All very good characteristics for a set of true wireless in-ear earbuds.  And let's not forget the obligatory AI product association with 6-mic AI clear calls.  This item simply check all the boxes.  And that's just what's printed on the box!  The many functions aside, it also meets all the certifications as well, according to all the certification labels on the box, not to mention recycling directions.  All in multiple languages.  In fine print, it also boasts 58ms dual channel ultra low latency,  Something about bass boost and treble balance \"tuned by Baseus App\".  I might have to look into that but, spoiler alert, it already sounds very good.  It shows 10 minutes rapid recharge for 2-5 hours of play time and can seamlessly connect to two different devices.  Then there's a symbol for not including an AC adapter, and another that indicates it will support 2-5W chargers.  Inside the box, you will find the charging case with the ear buds in them, extra sets of ear tips for different ear cannel sizing, and an USB-A to USB-C charge cord.  True to advertisement, charging was indeed fast using a higher powered USB-C charger.  It went from pulsating green to solid green in no time to which I interpret as being fully charged.  Opening the lid starts the pairing process and putting them in your ear you can hear your paired device audio output.  They fit perfectly in my ears out of the box and are quite comfortable with the included tips.  Don't even have to swap tips, bonus!  And I already raved about the bass that it can hit low.  The treble is good, too, not shrilly, but very pleasant.  The mids aren't forward but not too laid back either.  So far with the music I've tried, it's at least a b+ tier sound to my ears, easily beat the Air Pod Pro and even possibly be on par with the Moon Drop Space Travel.  More comparisons will be necessary and I'll update with any further discoveries.  The build quality and material used also means it will be quite durable.I chose to pair it with my Android phone running current up to date version with Developer Mode enabled.  It even displays its name properly (unlike many cheap devices that use weird names).  Even with Developer mode enabled, however, LDAC CODEC option is still grayed out.  Sad face.  I thought I saw somewhere in the description that it had LDAC support.  I'll have to check with one of the AI models and see if it can be un-grayed out.  Maybe download the app will help.",

        "review": "First ImpressionsThis initial review is mostly for sound only. I am referencing these to my Technics AZ Series, which to this day, by far, the best sounding, clearest, most enjoyable tws earbuds I have come across. This goes for soundstage, depth, clarity across ranges, and what I consider faithfulness in sound reproduction, what Dre refers to as how the music is meant to be heard. Only the Technics has been able to shine across all these dimensions, coming from a horn, drums, percussion, and guitar player.That said, against this reference the BP1s in Noise Cancelling mode holds its own against my Technics in sound clarity, particularly with the bass as oft mentioned, and the highs which are close, but noticeably not par. Fades, sizzles, done right. This is impressive for the price, a mere fraction of what the Technics is at. Also the battery life is much, much better. Much less range anxiety.LDAC needs to be vetted more, particularly with an LDAC supported source, one of my fav being the Quad DAC LG G series, if you can find one that works. The music on those devices are legendary, on par with Technics, but LG never has been recognized for it. I anticipate the LDAC being impressive also, but once again not on par with something like a reference bud, although with the right app and settings I'm absolutely certain it can match it. Based on what I'm hearing as I'm typing, the Baseus BP1 has what it takes to reach that level, it just needs the right help.I'll add to this once I get to play with the settings more, as I'm not a fan of downloading apps just to control the sound or use. Hasn't been used on calls, not sure I want to. There's dedicated buds for that. I haven't submerged these in water yet either. And the tips haven't been fully optimized. I'm trying not to use the Spinfits I have even though they have solid collars. They cause itchiness and discomfort, unlike their mainland counterparts. That said, word to Floss, the BP1s are a \"major, major, major GO.\"",

I would have thought these were $50+ just listening to them then seeing all the adjustments as well makes these a steal. They fit great, sound great, and the battery lasts forever as well.If you're on the fence, jump down and buy these now!Also, I want to give a shout out to their customer service for being absolutely top notch. I had an issue with something and they more than fixed it. Will definitely be buying from Baseus again and again!",

        "review": "Have you ever felt the gut rumbling (sub) bass?  As in with a few 18\" subwoofers going low and everything just rumble?  Now imagine hearing the same bass but without feeling it.  It's quite surreal and surreal is the best way to describe it when you are wearing this item and it hits the low bass.  You just don't feel it in your gut.  So revelation no. 1, yes, you can hear low bass, and no. 2, the BP1 Pro is pretty good.The item came nicely packaged, unlike the many cheap imports in plain plastic bags or cardboard boxes, it has a properly printed box with Hi-Res Audio (Wireless) label displayed prominently.  In addition, there is a bass label, too.  Never seen that before.  It also displays 55-hours battery life, -50dB adaptive hybrid ANC (active noise cancellation), IP55 splash resistant.  All very good characteristics for a set of true wireless in-ear earbuds.  And let's not forget the obligatory AI product association with 6-mic AI clear calls.  This item simply check all the boxes.  And that's just what's printed on the box!  The many functions aside, it also meets all the certifications as well, according to all the certification labels on the box, not to mention recycling directions.  All in multiple languages.  In fine print, it also boasts 58ms dual channel ultra low latency,  Something about bass boost and treble balance \"tuned by Baseus App\".  I might have to look into that but, spoiler alert, it already sounds very good.  It shows 10 minutes rapid recharge for 2-5 hours of play time and can seamlessly connect to two different devices.  Then there's a symbol for not including an AC adapter, and another that indicates it will support 2-5W chargers.  Inside the box, you will find the charging case with the ear buds in them, extra sets of ear tips for different ear cannel sizing, and an USB-A to USB-C charge cord.  True to advertisement, charging was indeed fast using a higher powered USB-C charger.  It went from pulsating green to solid green in no time to which I interpret as being fully charged.  Opening the lid starts the pairing process and putting them in your ear you can hear your paired device audio output.  They fit perfectly in my ears out of the box and are quite comfortable with the included tips.  Don't even have to swap tips, bonus!  And I already raved about the bass that it can hit low.  The treble is good, too, not shrilly, but very pleasant.  The mids aren't forward but not too laid back either.  So far with the music I've tried, it's at least a b+ tier sound to my ears, easily beat the Air Pod Pro and even possibly be on par with the Moon Drop Space Travel.  More comparisons will be necessary and I'll update with any further discoveries.  The build quality and material used also means it will be quite durable.I chose to pair it with my Android phone running current up to date version with Developer Mode enabled.  It even displays its name properly (unlike many cheap devices that use weird names).  Even with Developer mode enabled, however, LDAC CODEC option is still grayed out.  Sad face.  I thought I saw somewhere in the description that it had LDAC support.  I'll have to check with one of the AI models and see if it can be un-grayed out.  Maybe download the app will help.",

The sound quality is on par with much higher-priced brands, delivering clear highs, solid bass, and an overall balanced profile that makes music and calls sound great. The companion app is refreshingly straightforward\u2014the controls are simple and intuitive, without the clutter you find in some other brands. On top of that, the earbuds fit my ears perfectly, staying comfortable even during long use.Overall, an excellent value that easily exceeds expectations.",

        "review": "First ImpressionsThis initial review is mostly for sound only. I am referencing these to my Technics AZ Series, which to this day, by far, the best sounding, clearest, most enjoyable tws earbuds I have come across. This goes for soundstage, depth, clarity across ranges, and what I consider faithfulness in sound reproduction, what Dre refers to as how the music is meant to be heard. Only the Technics has been able to shine across all these dimensions, coming from a horn, drums, percussion, and guitar player.That said, against this reference the BP1s in Noise Cancelling mode holds its own against my Technics in sound clarity, particularly with the bass as oft mentioned, and the highs which are close, but noticeably not par. Fades, sizzles, done right. This is impressive for the price, a mere fraction of what the Technics is at. Also the battery life is much, much better. Much less range anxiety.LDAC needs to be vetted more, particularly with an LDAC supported source, one of my fav being the Quad DAC LG G series, if you can find one that works. The music on those devices are legendary, on par with Technics, but LG never has been recognized for it. I anticipate the LDAC being impressive also, but once again not on par with something like a reference bud, although with the right app and settings I'm absolutely certain it can match it. Based on what I'm hearing as I'm typing, the Baseus BP1 has what it takes to reach that level, it just needs the right help.I'll add to this once I get to play with the settings more, as I'm not a fan of downloading apps just to control the sound or use. Hasn't been used on calls, not sure I want to. There's dedicated buds for that. I haven't submerged these in water yet either. And the tips haven't been fully optimized. I'm trying not to use the Spinfits I have even though they have solid collars. They cause itchiness and discomfort, unlike their mainland counterparts. That said, word to Floss, the BP1s are a \"major, major, major GO.\"",

        "review": "Overall, very solid buds. Their sound, battery, controls, feel, fit, and in app support is all very solid.Let\u2019s start with the pros.Sound quality is clean with an emphasis on the low and on highs, so a bit of a V Shape tuning. The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn\u2019t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price. I love the magnet on them since Baseus products usually have a strong magnet to them.Now for the cons.Sound quality is great, superb even, but the classics bass thump is lacking a bit. I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn\u2019t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have. The XH1\u2019s have it, and so it was mildly surprising to see these didn\u2019t have it.Fit is good, but it could definitely be better. With light use and not as heavy a move, they wouldn\u2019t fall out, but if I were to exercise, these would most likely slip. The limited use of 3 eartips definitely does not help.App Support could also be better. The Dolby Audio isn\u2019t the best and custom EQ doesn\u2019t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from. They sound quieter and a bit more flat. Also, as mentioned the above, the lack of bass boost button is upsetting.Overall, my experience with these have been positive so far and will keep testing them out.",

Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "Baseus really hit a homerun with these. I was a little skeptical at first just from the clip on design itself and the fact that most clipons ive tried have left me feeling disappointed. But these are an absolute MUST buy for anyone looking for a clip on.The sound is awesome, at low volume (30% or so) they do a great job of still being clearly audible and having a bass that is still present. Once you crank it up to 70-80 they definitely pump out some nice sound. Top that off with the nice soft rubber grips and a sturdy fit you have yourself not only a comfortable earbud but a great WORKOUT earbud.The battery life is good as well, i went a whole session with volume at about 60% and got almost 9 hours from them which is insane. The button on each earbud can be customized with many options to choose from which is nice too. I haven't necessarily used them for calls specifically but ended up using them on a discord call and got zero complaints so i assume they must be fine as well.Overall these are easy to recommend for anyone interested in clip ons and especially as a gift option.",

        "review": "I just purchased these Baseus open ear buds to replace my old Jlab ones. So far they are great. I primarily use them for music listening while still being able to pick up outside sounds and keep mobile. The Bose bass sounds excellent with no distortion. They are lightweight and comfortable with thoughtful little rubber nubs where they come in contact with your ears. Buttons work fine. I personally like the open ear ring type buds.

        "review": "As a previous owner the Baseus MC1 Pro, I already had high expectations for the XC1.The MC1 Pro sounded great and was very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "Baseus really hit a homerun with these. I was a little skeptical at first just from the clip on design itself and the fact that most clipons ive tried have left me feeling disappointed. But these are an absolute MUST buy for anyone looking for a clip on.The sound is awesome, at low volume (30% or so) they do a great job of still being clearly audible and having a bass that is still present. Once you crank it up to 70-80 they definitely pump out some nice sound. Top that off with the nice soft rubber grips and a sturdy fit you have yourself not only a comfortable earbud but a great WORKOUT earbud.The battery life is good as well, i went a whole session with volume at about 60% and got almost 9 hours from them which is insane. The button on each earbud can be customized with many options to choose from which is nice too. I haven't necessarily used them for calls specifically but ended up using them on a discord call and got zero complaints so i assume they must be fine as well.Overall these are easy to recommend for anyone interested in clip ons and especially as a gift option.",

        "review": "I just purchased these Baseus open ear buds to replace my old Jlab ones. So far they are great. I primarily use them for music listening while still being able to pick up outside sounds and keep mobile. The Bose bass sounds excellent with no distortion. They are lightweight and comfortable with thoughtful little rubber nubs where they come in contact with your ears. Buttons work fine. I personally like the open ear ring type buds. They look like some kind of cyber-tribal piercing thing, which works for me. I still wish they\u2019d invent an accessory miniature subwoofer that clips into your nostrils through.Update 12/25: After a couple of months I\u2019m still liken\u2019 these ear bud.

        "review": "This review is for Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-ear Headphones. (in case this review is lumped together with other models they sell)They sound great in quiet environments because the overall output levels can't get very loud, made worse by lower bass response than many other open ear designs.In a quiet environment they have a very clean output that sounds pretty good if you aren't playing anything with much low frequency content.  I don't mean it doesn't match basshead expectations, I mean there's country music that you will be disappointed with the lack of strong bass.  It gets more disappointing if you specifically listen to decaf/rebassed tracks or anything that plays below about 32Hz... levels roll off pretty quickly below that, being absent below 22 or 23Hz.Pressing the open ear transducers to close off the open ear gap doesn't help much.  They are about as good as they are gonna get in their natural positions.They are good for most music.Their bluetooth range is pretty impressive.Battery endurance is super good due to truncated bass response below about 30Hz.  Usually I am seeing 12-14 hours on a single full charge, running down to 15-20% remaining.  This is a mix of music, YouTube, calls, and idle time in my work day.Comfort is really good: I can put them over my ears at 7AM and take them off at 9PM without ear fatigue or discomfort.  That beats my AfterShokz models which are bone conduction for comfort, though sound clarity is superior with these Baseus headphones.A breeze above 15mph makes phone calls disappointing, but below that or indoors they are actually great for calls.I will be buying a different set in the near future and giving these to a friend that mostly stays indoors.  Not for me, as I spend a lot of time outside in a windy state.I tried all supported Codecs, and leave them connected by LDAC or AptX HD.  These are good enough to tell the difference between higher bit rate codecs and SBC easily.My biggest issue is that they don't get loud enough for use in a noisy city street, and secondary they roll off the bass output above the bottom end of typical modern country, R&B, or Hip Hop music tracks.I am not looking for extra bass, only balanced bass that accurately plays evenly down to what an organ or bass drum should sound like.So, tldr: good soundfield recreation if you are okay with truncated bass spectrum and lower total output in trade for excellent battery endurance.",

        "review": "I really prefer open-earbuds to in-earbuds, cuz after I got some foam tips for better comfort - my ears still get \"swamp ear\" and get irritated after long use. So I bought Bose Ultra open buds and Shokz open fit buds. Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth. In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it. I finally decided to see if there was a better alternative and stumbled upon these Baseus Bowie MC1 clip earbuds, which seemed like they could be the answer.\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9cPro\u2019s:The fit is excellent, the sound is excellent, the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable. When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears. The sound was good when I was running.The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market. For me and my ears, the Baseus is an excellent buy. These are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the Baseus really improved. I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with. I still like the Baseus ear clip design vs the earhook. So which do I prefer. Running and exercising-Baseus without a doubt.Bose Ultra is too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds. They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting. Should be priced around the Soundcore and Shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end. For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity. Most of all a larger and louder volume level. I\u2019m returning them. My Baseus Bowie MC1 do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged. These are a great option for an open-ear design at this price point, the sound is very full and balanced, impressive bass and volume without becoming distorted, I rarely feel the need to turn them up too much even when in a noisy area.\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9cWhat I liked:\u27641) Very comfortable, light weight, you will not even know that you are wearing it\ud83e\udde12) Easy to put on and remove and just one clicker on the back of the ear on each earbud to control settings like volume, play next or previous track, take a call or end it or cycle through the modes (default list of modes can be assigned to each earbud so that you can cycle through the shortcuts you use the most).\ud83d\udc9b3) Pushing it downwards inside the ear gives a higher bass and louder sound. My ears are small so this could be different for different ear sizes. The sound quality is premium and you can move it a bit to find the right spot for best sound.\ud83d\udc9a4) Call quality is good. I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside\ud83d\udc996) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music.\ud83d\udc9c7) Baseus app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available.\u27648) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life. Up to 9-10 hours of play time and up to an extra 31 hours of battery life in the charging case.",

Build quality is good too.  Overall I really like them and plan to keep them.HOWEVER, after a week of use, I realize the ear buds mic will stop working either when I walk away from my laptop like going to bathroom or kitchen.  It seems the disconnection is random to me.  I am not sure it's because of distance or period of not streaming.  But the worst is the mic will not work properly even the earbuds reconnect with my laptop.  I HAVE to unpair and repair the earbuds with my laptop.  As I use this earbuds for work from home meetings, this random disconnection / malfunction of mic is such a pain that finally I decided to return the earbuds.  It is such a shame.  I did see one another user commented the same issue but I thought that was random.  But in my case, it happens pretty much everyday.... so if you want to use this earbuds for meetings, be careful.  Otherwise this earbuds is almost perfect for me.",

I am an equestrian and use these with my coach so I can hear her better in crowded environments like at shows or windy days. They stay on great and never had them slip or move while I was riding or running. I recently lost the case at the airport and e-mailed the company to see if I could just buy the case since I still had the earbuds. They were kind enough to send me a new set! Not only are these earbuds fantastic quality and a great price but the customer service is top notch and quick to respond.",

        "review": "I really prefer open-earbuds to in-earbuds, cuz after I got some foam tips for better comfort - my ears still get \"swamp ear\" and get irritated after long use. So I bought Bose Ultra open buds and Shokz open fit buds. Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth. In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it. I finally decided to see if there was a better alternative and stumbled upon these Baseus Bowie MC1 clip earbuds, which seemed like they could be the answer.\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9cPro\u2019s:The fit is excellent, the sound is excellent, the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable. When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears. The sound was good when I was running.The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market. For me and my ears, the Baseus is an excellent buy. These are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the Baseus really improved. I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with. I still like the Baseus ear clip design vs the earhook. So which do I prefer. Running and exercising-Baseus without a doubt.Bose Ultra is too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds. They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting. Should be priced around the Soundcore and Shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end. For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity. Most of all a larger and louder volume level. I\u2019m returning them. My Baseus Bowie MC1 do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged. These are a great option for an open-ear design at this price point, the sound is very full and balanced, impressive bass and volume without becoming distorted, I rarely feel the need to turn them up too much even when in a noisy area.\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9cWhat I liked:\u27641) Very comfortable, light weight, you will not even know that you are wearing it\ud83e\udde12) Easy to put on and remove and just one clicker on the back of the ear on each earbud to control settings like volume, play next or previous track, take a call or end it or cycle through the modes (default list of modes can be assigned to each earbud so that you can cycle through the shortcuts you use the most).\ud83d\udc9b3) Pushing it downwards inside the ear gives a higher bass and louder sound. My ears are small so this could be different for different ear sizes. The sound quality is premium and you can move it a bit to find the right spot for best sound.\ud83d\udc9a4) Call quality is good. I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside\ud83d\udc996) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music.\ud83d\udc9c7) Baseus app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available.\u27648) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life. Up to 9-10 hours of play time and up to an extra 31 hours of battery life in the charging case.",

I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced. The Bowie 30 Max are quickly becoming my favorite. They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max. They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp. The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use, while the Bowie 30 Max still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Spatial Audio with Head Tracking\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaWhat sets these headphones apart is their Spatial Audio feature, which takes your listening experience to the next level. Feel like you're right in the middle of the action, with sound that surrounds you in all directions, adding depth and dimension to your favorite content. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment. (Same as Bose QC Ultra, Airpods Max)\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83c\udfa7Noise Cancelling\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5I would say, at $99 ANC definetly worth the price.

These sleek, over-the-ear headphones deliver unparalleled audio quality and immersive experiences, especially with the addition of Spatial Audio.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83c\udfa7Sound\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced. The Bowie 30 Max are quickly becoming my favorite. They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max. They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp. The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use, while the Bowie 30 Max still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Spatial Audio with Head Tracking\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaWhat sets these headphones apart is their Spatial Audio feature, which takes your listening experience to the next level. Feel like you're right in the middle of the action, with sound that surrounds you in all directions, adding depth and dimension to your favorite content. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment.

        "review": "These are currently my favorite headphones.  I'll highlight the pro's and few con's (because they are perfect) below...Pros:--Price.  I got these super cheap on sale (~$20).  From a quality and features standpoint, these headphones punch way above their class.--Super comfortable.  They are light but, more importantly, don't feel intrusive.  I love the open ear design.  Nothing is jammed in my ear resulting in zero fatigue, hot spots or swamp ear.  I have taken naps with them on (love being able to listen to music while napping).  Also, as someone who wears glasses, I love that there's no contact of any point between the headphones and glasses.  There's no feeling of pressure or the glasses sitting funny.--Physical buttons (especially at this price point).  I appreciate physical buttons over touch sensitivity.  It allows for precise execution of functions.-The accompanying app.  I think this feature separates these headphones from other low cost headphones.  I love that I'm able to select from different EQ setting to find one that best fits my tastes.  It can also be customized but my ears aren't that particular.  The ability to customize the button functions is also appreciated.--Sound.  To me, the sound quality is excellent overall.  The volume is loud enough against outside ambient noise while the open ear design allows me to hear my surroundings.  Couple with the EQ settings, my music sounds great.  With the volume down enough, I can also carry on conversations without having to remove them.--Fit.  They go with little fuss and stay on!  This allows me to enjoy my music while playing sports.  The only time they've moved out of place was when I accidentally hit them.Cons:--The Finding Headphone feature in the app.  It isn't completely useless as it will show the headphone's last active location but, the call L/R feature does not work unless they are out of the case and in use.  This lack of functionality caused me to think that I lost my headphones.  After replacing them with a different set of headphone that were on sale at the time (Soundcore V20i), they were found in my jacket pocket hanging in the closet at home lol.-Phone calls.  In louder settings, it was hard to hear my calls, even at maximum volume.  The mic, however, seemed fine as I have never gotten complaints.--Playtime (this is the main reason why I dropped a star).  I'm getting nowhere near the 7.5 hour playtime on a single charge.  I may be getting 5 hours at low to moderate volume.  For home use, this is totally fine as I'm constantly popping them on and off.  In the office, however, I would have them on all the time (because of the comfort).  Even though 15 minutes of charge will get me 2 more hours of play to get me through the rest of my work day, I opt to use the Soundcore V20i that I bought when I thought these were lost.  Although not as comfortable with glasses on, they last my entire work day.--Quality control.  This is more of a nit-pick, but the button on the right earpiece is more sunken in than the one on the left almost eliminating haptic feedback.  I can't tell when it's pressed.  This makes using it challenging enough to discourage me from using it.  I mainly use it to increase the volume but will use the phone instead (when it's with me).Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend them.  For the price, they are hard to beat.",

        "review": "I love these! I have the BP1 Pro which are good, but they don't stay put when I'm active, so I'm constantly having to adjust them. The BC1 clip on headphones solves this problem completely. Since they're open ear, they aren't noise-cancelling, but in return you get incredible comfort (nothing sticking in your ear canal) and most importantly, they don't fall out or move around. This design is genius. The sound is different, but I actually prefer it. There's a place for noise-cancelling earbuds (mowing the lawn), but the greater comfort far outweighs the benefit of noise cancellation in most situations. The sound itself is more natural and comfortable for TV viewing and other long listening situations, no ear fatigue. I've had zero issues with them so far, they are definitely my new favorite earbuds. For noise cancellation earbuds, I do prefer my Anker Soundcore2 over my BC1 Pro, though.",

The only time they've moved out of place was when I accidentally hit them.Cons:--The Finding Headphone feature in the app.  It isn't completely useless as it will show the headphone's last active location but, the call L/R feature does not work unless they are out of the case and in use.  This lack of functionality caused me to think that I lost my headphones.  After replacing them with a different set of headphone that were on sale at the time (Soundcore V20i), they were found in my jacket pocket hanging in the closet at home lol.-Phone calls.  In louder settings, it was hard to hear my calls, even at maximum volume.  The mic, however, seemed fine as I have never gotten complaints.--Playtime (this is the main reason why I dropped a star).  I'm getting nowhere near the 7.5 hour playtime on a single charge.  I may be getting 5 hours at low to moderate volume.  For home use, this is totally fine as I'm constantly popping them on and off.  In the office, however, I would have them on all the time (because of the comfort).  Even though 15 minutes of charge will get me 2 more hours of play to get me through the rest of my work day, I opt to use the Soundcore V20i that I bought when I thought these were lost.  Although not as comfortable with glasses on, they last my entire work day.--Quality control.  This is more of a nit-pick, but the button on the right earpiece is more sunken in than the one on the left almost eliminating haptic feedback.  I can't tell when it's pressed.  This makes using it challenging enough to discourage me from using it.  I mainly use it to increase the volume but will use the phone instead (when it's with me).Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend them.  For the price, they are hard to beat.",

        "review": "I love these! I have the BP1 Pro which are good, but they don't stay put when I'm active, so I'm constantly having to adjust them. The BC1 clip on headphones solves this problem completely. Since they're open ear, they aren't noise-cancelling, but in return you get incredible comfort (nothing sticking in your ear canal) and most importantly, they don't fall out or move around. This design is genius. The sound is different, but I actually prefer it. There's a place for noise-cancelling earbuds (mowing the lawn), but the greater comfort far outweighs the benefit of noise cancellation in most situations. The sound itself is more natural and comfortable for TV viewing and other long listening situations, no ear fatigue. I've had zero issues with them so far, they are definitely my new favorite earbuds. For noise cancellation earbuds, I do prefer my Anker Soundcore2 over my BC1 Pro, though.",

        "review": "Good sound, comfortable, good battery time, but the left earpiece mostly cuts out after a couple miles. Cleaned and charged, same issue on next run. I do sweat a lot, so maybe it's just me, but right now returning for a replacement.  If it would just completely cut out would actually be better, but it just starts sporadically connecting for a second and cuts out, so it's pretty annoying.",

The sound quality is really impressive, particularly the bass. One thing I did notice was that sometimes a song will start playing on one bud before being picked up by the other one. Thought that was a little weird, but that might've been caused by my phone or the app I was streaming from at the time. I haven't made many calls with the headphones yet but I did demo the mic for a friend via a Whatsapp message. Listening back, both she and I found it to be a bit lacking in clarity, but that might also have been an issue with my connection.

Frankly, I'm annoyed to have gotten Huawei in the first place! The Baseus are louder, lighter, have a longer battery life, better bass, and with the app, great audio customization. The music/cinema functions make listening to my audiobooks and music night and day!! On my Huawei, these features barely made any difference with the incredibly quiet audio. (You do have to reset this feature every time you use the buds, but I would need to switch between them anyway, so it isn't much of a bother). The custom EQ also made the audio quality much better than what you get straight out of the box! The Huaweis have a higher quality build and technically crisper audio, but they are so quiet it often barely matters. Because the Baseus are louder, they leak audio a bit more, but it's very minor, and in the settings I use them, it is not an issue. Frankly, I believe the Bluetooth connection is better than my Huaweis. When I step out of range they automatically reconnect, whereas I have to manually reconnect my Huaweis. One complaint I have is that the magnets keeping the case shut are very weak and pop open with a gentle brush against something. However, the magnets keeping the earbuds secure are solid and thus have yet to cause any fallage. It mostly causes an issue when it pops open in my bag and steals my audio or calls, but again, very worth it for the price. The build is somewhat cheap plastic, but frankly that doesn't bother me because it's so light and comfortable on the ear. All in all, more than worth the price!",

The open design on these let me be fully aware of my surroundings, it's like there's just a small Bluetooth speaker next to me. I was also glad I could eat my lunch with these on without them interfering or falling off. The battery life is fine for my needs I completely drained one ear bud and got the other one down to about 50% on a 9 hour work shift. They don't budge and stay firmly in place even with constant laying down and snappy movements during my work day. The build quality is the typical almost flimsy plastic feel that is just expected at this price point but I don't mind. There is a physical button on each earbud that has the usual controls of pausing, skipping, and adjusting volume that works most of the time but I do experience about a 2 second delayed response.

They are great for work because I can hear what's going on around me, there is a simple button push to pause and also to adjust the volume. I recommended these to friends already! The batter life is fantastic and they are so easy to use.",

        "review": "Absolutely BLOWN AWAY by these earbuds! I previously used my Huawei FreeClips for work, but didn't want to use a $150 pair of earbuds on the job. Frankly, I'm annoyed to have gotten Huawei in the first place! The Baseus are louder, lighter, have a longer battery life, better bass, and with the app, great audio customization. The music/cinema functions make listening to my audiobooks and music night and day!! On my Huawei, these features barely made any difference with the incredibly quiet audio. (You do have to reset this feature every time you use the buds, but I would need to switch between them anyway, so it isn't much of a bother). The custom EQ also made the audio quality much better than what you get straight out of the box! The Huaweis have a higher quality build and technically crisper audio, but they are so quiet it often barely matters. Because the Baseus are louder, they leak audio a bit more, but it's very minor, and in the settings I use them, it is not an issue. Frankly, I believe the Bluetooth connection is better than my Huaweis. When I step out of range they automatically reconnect, whereas I have to manually reconnect my Huaweis. One complaint I have is that the magnets keeping the case shut are very weak and pop open with a gentle brush against something. However, the magnets keeping the earbuds secure are solid and thus have yet to cause any fallage. It mostly causes an issue when it pops open in my bag and steals my audio or calls, but again, very worth it for the price. The build is somewhat cheap plastic, but frankly that doesn't bother me because it's so light and comfortable on the ear. All in all, more than worth the price!",

        "review": "Very surprised by the sound quality of these! Was expecting something that sounded flat like a alarm clock speaker but the drivers in these actually deliver full bodied sound with adequate bass and sharp trebles. The fit may seem awkward at first but my ears got used to them after an hour to the point where I didn't feel like I had them on. The open design on these let me be fully aware of my surroundings, it's like there's just a small Bluetooth speaker next to me. I was also glad I could eat my lunch with these on without them interfering or falling off. The battery life is fine for my needs I completely drained one ear bud and got the other one down to about 50% on a 9 hour work shift. They don't budge and stay firmly in place even with constant laying down and snappy movements during my work day. The build quality is the typical almost flimsy plastic feel that is just expected at this price point but I don't mind. There is a physical button on each earbud that has the usual controls of pausing, skipping, and adjusting volume that works most of the time but I do experience about a 2 second delayed response. For the price I would strongly recommend these, they deliver exactly what I needed to enjoy my music while at work.",

They are very comfortable and I hard notice them at all.  I can hear every call.  The Bluetooth distance seems to be a few feet long too.  For the price (got mine for $18.99), you got to try these.",

And I don't know if only the right one is for phone calls but ONLY my right one works for phone calls, left one does not, I would not recommend these.UPDATE. 11/08/05After the possibly defective product, Hana from Baseus customer service reached out to me apologized for my bad experience, gave me a full refund then offered me an UPGRADED PAIR absolutely free of charge!! Free shipping included, tried them and I'm impressed with the build quality, but more so the sound, they sound very good, with good volume and good and quick connectivity, These are actually way , way better than the Monsters I purchased in sound quality. Some of the best and friendly customers service I've experienced here on Amazon, I could now say I highly recommend the Baseus MC1, you will not regret it!! Oh and if you do get a defective pair. do not worry THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. Thank you Hana from BASEUS.",

I also love the Bluetooth connection reliability! I'm not sure what the honest range is because I've worn these around the house while my phone was left on the charger and never had the connection break up. I've tested it at least 20-30 feet through walls in other rooms. That's pretty good by my experience with cheap earbuds. The only thing I do not like is the charge indicator on the base unit. It's just a single LED that blinks. There is no percentage bar or battery life indicator. It could be nearly dead or mostly charged I have no idea. This is particularly bad as the batteries for the base are kind of small and it has left me with dead headphones and a dead base that wasn't charging them unknown to me. I also kind of hate the case. It's kind of oval shaped and the top half has a ridge you can grip onto to open the lid but the lower half is curved and smooth leaving you nothing to grip onto.

        "review": "These are actually surprisingly nice. To be clear, I ordered them because they were cheap and it's nice to have a set in my car for when I'm stuck waiting at a doctors appointment or something. When I ordered them I did not notice they were \"open ear\" fit. Unlike most headphones of this type they do not actually have a rubber earbud tip that goes in your ear. These are actually just a speaker that sits over your ear. At first this struck me as a cheap design meant to cut costs but this is actually surprisingly pleasant. I feel they are more comfortable. The ear buds that go in my ear can be irritating after wearing them a while. These you almost forget your wearing. I like that they do not completely block out other sounds around you so can hear whats going on around you. Now you might say well but I don't want to hear all the noise around me I want to hear what I'm listening too! Because the speakers are physically over your ear they do block outside sounds notably just not as completely as say a conventional earbud does. I can still hear when someone calls my name or when the alarm on my cook timer goes off but outside sounds are not so much such that  I find it disruptive to what I am listening to. I also love the Bluetooth connection reliability! I'm not sure what the honest range is because I've worn these around the house while my phone was left on the charger and never had the connection break up. I've tested it at least 20-30 feet through walls in other rooms. That's pretty good by my experience with cheap earbuds. The only thing I do not like is the charge indicator on the base unit. It's just a single LED that blinks. There is no percentage bar or battery life indicator. It could be nearly dead or mostly charged I have no idea. This is particularly bad as the batteries for the base are kind of small and it has left me with dead headphones and a dead base that wasn't charging them unknown to me. I also kind of hate the case. It's kind of oval shaped and the top half has a ridge you can grip onto to open the lid but the lower half is curved and smooth leaving you nothing to grip onto. It's unnecessarily difficult and annoying to open and has caused me to drop it several times. For the money I think they are great. They fit well, they sound good, they are cheap, reliable. They represent a great value and I have bought a few pairs just to wear around the house while I'm doing chores or take to work.EDIT: So there is one more thing I want to add to these. I live in a colder climate and typically when I have to shovel snow I like to put in earbuds on so I can listen to something while I work. The problem is I also have to wear a hat that covers my ears to keep warm. Because the elastic puts pressure on the earbuds the classical style earbud gets jammed into my ear canal and is very uncomfortable borderline painful. I either have to take the earbuds out or wear my hat so it doesn't cover my ears which is at best uncomfortably cold and at worst leaves me vulnerable to frostbite, no joke or exaggeration there. These earbuds that just have speakers over the ear and do not actually go into the ear canal can be comfortably worn with a winter hat fully covering my ear. This is a HUGE benefit for poor souls like me who have to work outside in cold climates. Again this seemed like a cheap design at first but I'm increasingly finding I actually like it a lot better than the classic earbud design.",

        "review": "One of the best over the ear phones. It delivers strong bass clarity while helping you maintain awareness around you as you could also hear surrounding noise of your environment. Being through the rain with it and still works great.Unlike the others the Baseus elite 2i open ear headphones doesn't hurt your ears after extended use, I could wear it for extended periods without feeling discomfort on or around my earsIt has exceptionally strong battery life and call clarity is one of the best.  It is a good buy I will definitely buy again.",

Fix by affixing tape to the inside bottom half of the case and folding it over it itself outside the case creating a full tab\u2022 No official app supportfor the Eli 2i fit (Android, ios)  No way to customize touch\u2022 No multipoint\u2022 Sound is good but goes bad at higher volume. Doesn't sound as clear as the Anker v20i\u2022 No neck cord as seen in the review images\u2022 Pairs quickly to the last connected device\u2022 Fit is comfortable even in bed",

        "review": "I've had mixed experiences with Baseus earphones before; I usually love them but find them to be less durable than I'd like.In this case, knock on wood, not only have I found the sound good and the battery life excellent, they've held up very well to extended use in sweaty conditions. Unlike earbuds that get inserted into the ear, I'm a lot less likely to wind up fostering an ear infection or winding up with part of an earbud stuck in my ear.These are also very comfortable. Eventually, I do need to adjust them, but I can forget I'm wearing them for an hour or more. They're very light.I love that they're USBC and charge with the same charger as my other devices. The case has additional battery that adds an extra couple of sessions of charging in reserve.If there's one thing I'd change, I find it hard to open the charging case sometimes. This isn't a big design issue, but it could use a slightly larger lip for people with short nails to use to open the case.",

        "review": "These are fine. Decent sound and battery life, especially for the price (under $20).  However, with that lower price comes some pretty noticeable cons. The plastic feels cheap. The new case is difficult to grip to open.  Sound while decently loud and balanced has no app you can use to change the sound profile... Pretty much in every area this is a downgrade from the earlier model (Eli sport 1).  If you're okay with those faults these are a good little set of over the ear earbuds, especially for the price.",

It's quite surreal and surreal is the best way to describe it when you are wearing this item and it hits the low bass.  You just don't feel it in your gut.  So revelation no. 1, yes, you can hear low bass, and no. 2, the BP1 Pro is pretty good.The item came nicely packaged, unlike the many cheap imports in plain plastic bags or cardboard boxes, it has a properly printed box with Hi-Res Audio (Wireless) label displayed prominently.  In addition, there is a bass label, too.  Never seen that before.  It also displays 55-hours battery life, -50dB adaptive hybrid ANC (active noise cancellation), IP55 splash resistant.  All very good characteristics for a set of true wireless in-ear earbuds.  And let's not forget the obligatory AI product association with 6-mic AI clear calls.  This item simply check all the boxes.  And that's just what's printed on the box!  The many functions aside, it also meets all the certifications as well, according to all the certification labels on the box, not to mention recycling directions.  All in multiple languages.  In fine print, it also boasts 58ms dual channel ultra low latency,  Something about bass boost and treble balance \"tuned by Baseus App\".  I might have to look into that but, spoiler alert, it already sounds very good.  It shows 10 minutes rapid recharge for 2-5 hours of play time and can seamlessly connect to two different devices.  Then there's a symbol for not including an AC adapter, and another that indicates it will support 2-5W chargers.  Inside the box, you will find the charging case with the ear buds in them, extra sets of ear tips for different ear cannel sizing, and an USB-A to USB-C charge cord.  True to advertisement, charging was indeed fast using a higher powered USB-C charger.  It went from pulsating green to solid green in no time to which I interpret as being fully charged.  Opening the lid starts the pairing process and putting them in your ear you can hear your paired device audio output.  They fit perfectly in my ears out of the box and are quite comfortable with the included tips.  Don't even have to swap tips, bonus!  And I already raved about the bass that it can hit low.  The treble is good, too, not shrilly, but very pleasant.  The mids aren't forward but not too laid back either.  So far with the music I've tried, it's at least a b+ tier sound to my ears, easily beat the Air Pod Pro and even possibly be on par with the Moon Drop Space Travel.  More comparisons will be necessary and I'll update with any further discoveries.  The build quality and material used also means it will be quite durable.I chose to pair it with my Android phone running current up to date version with Developer Mode enabled.  It even displays its name properly (unlike many cheap devices that use weird names).  Even with Developer mode enabled, however, LDAC CODEC option is still grayed out.  Sad face.

I am referencing these to my Technics AZ Series, which to this day, by far, the best sounding, clearest, most enjoyable tws earbuds I have come across.

        "review": "Overall, very solid buds. Their sound, battery, controls, feel, fit, and in app support is all very solid.Let\u2019s start with the pros.Sound quality is clean with an emphasis on the low and on highs, so a bit of a V Shape tuning. The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn\u2019t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price. I love the magnet on them since Baseus products usually have a strong magnet to them.Now for the cons.Sound quality is great, superb even, but the classics bass thump is lacking a bit. I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn\u2019t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have. The XH1\u2019s have it, and so it was mildly surprising to see these didn\u2019t have it.Fit is good, but it could definitely be better. With light use and not as heavy a move, they wouldn\u2019t fall out, but if I were to exercise, these would most likely slip. The limited use of 3 eartips definitely does not help.App Support could also be better. The Dolby Audio isn\u2019t the best and custom EQ doesn\u2019t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from. They sound quieter and a bit more flat. Also, as mentioned the above, the lack of bass boost button is upsetting.Overall, my experience with these have been positive so far and will keep testing them out.",

Fortunately the hiss does not increase with volume level, so if you listen at \"normal\" volume and the music doesn't have a very quiet passage, you probably won't notice it.The Gesture Settings controls offer very good customization options. Lots of flexibility for the tap commands. However, although you can adjust volume level, there is no aural feedback to let you know you've reached the maximum setting. Other earbuds I've tried do have this feature.If you are sitting still or walking, they stay in the ear pretty well. My left ear must have a bit of an odd shape because that one loosens up and doesn't sound as good when it does. The right one is fine though.EQ mode - If you are using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings, the only EQ mode you can use is \"Baseus Classic\" . If you attempt to switch to another EQ setting, it turns off Spatial Acoustics, which degrades both the volume level and sound quality.The Spatial Acoustics settings actually sound pretty good, but no EQ customization is possible. Personally I prefer the Cinema setting as it is a little less harsh in the high end.Bass Boost - there are five levels to choose from, but none of them have any noticeable effect on the sound.The stock EQ mode settings are OK, but there isn't much difference between them, and you cannot actually see a graph of which frequencies are boost/cut for each.The customizable EQ is shockingly bad. No matter what you do, I will bet money that you cannot make it sound even halfway decent.  Sounds like AM radio to me. Completely worthless to the user.The charge indicator light on the case is pretty useless. There is no readout of battery level, just a single LED indicator that changes color depending on charge level. The highest level indicator - green - means the battery level is between 40% and 100%. That's quite a range! There isn't even a case battery level readout in the phone app.The case does not accommodate wireless charging.Bottom line: these earbuds are pretty comfortable, and sound pretty decent when using one of the Spatial Acoustics settings.

        "review": "I've got to be honest, I'm blown away by the sound quality of these cheap earbuds. I downloaded the Baseus app and fooled around with the different sound settings, settling on creating a custom EQ. I admit I'm not a big bass guy but the app also has a \"mega bass\" setting which I activated and it added volume and a little thump that passed my limited bass comfort. The EQ (and bass) also added volume which is important since these clips rest close to your ear but not in the ear. I use the Shanling M0 Pro (2nd gen) which I've been using with wired Grado headphones in the gym. I didn't feel stupid with the big phones on my head since, afterall, the tennis pros and Lebron James come out wearing big phones. With several earlier buds the bluetooth connection on the Shanling did stumble and stutter a bit which I realized was not the buds but the player. The Baseus buds struggled the least, which leads me to conclude the bluetooth connection is probably stronger. As far as comfort, the 1st ime I tried them, 2 hours later I was in the shower sudsing up my head when you guessed it, I still had them on. I highly recommend these buds.",

        "review": "I'm a big fan of Baseus earbuds. These things are amazing. I gave my last one to my elderly uncle who refuses to get a hearing aid... These are pretty loud and don't crack on high volume. The bass is pretty good given they're open ear.. they're extremely comfortable and very light weight. Battery life is long enough to last all night.. I sleep with them on.",

        "review": "This review is for Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-ear Headphones. (in case this review is lumped together with other models they sell)They sound great in quiet environments because the overall output levels can't get very loud, made worse by lower bass response than many other open ear designs.In a quiet environment they have a very clean output that sounds pretty good if you aren't playing anything with much low frequency content.  I don't mean it doesn't match basshead expectations, I mean there's country music that you will be disappointed with the lack of strong bass.  It gets more disappointing if you specifically listen to decaf/rebassed tracks or anything that plays below about 32Hz... levels roll off pretty quickly below that, being absent below 22 or 23Hz.Pressing the open ear transducers to close off the open ear gap doesn't help much.  They are about as good as they are gonna get in their natural positions.They are good for most music.Their bluetooth range is pretty impressive.Battery endurance is super good due to truncated bass response below about 30Hz.  Usually I am seeing 12-14 hours on a single full charge, running down to 15-20% remaining.  This is a mix of music, YouTube, calls, and idle time in my work day.Comfort is really good: I can put them over my ears at 7AM and take them off at 9PM without ear fatigue or discomfort.  That beats my AfterShokz models which are bone conduction for comfort, though sound clarity is superior with these Baseus headphones.A breeze above 15mph makes phone calls disappointing, but below that or indoors they are actually great for calls.I will be buying a different set in the near future and giving these to a friend that mostly stays indoors.  Not for me, as I spend a lot of time outside in a windy state.I tried all supported Codecs, and leave them connected by LDAC or AptX HD.  These are good enough to tell the difference between higher bit rate codecs and SBC easily.My biggest issue is that they don't get loud enough for use in a noisy city street, and secondary they roll off the bass output above the bottom end of typical modern country, R&B, or Hip Hop music tracks.I am not looking for extra bass, only balanced bass that accurately plays evenly down to what an organ or bass drum should sound like.So, tldr: good soundfield recreation if you are okay with truncated bass spectrum and lower total output in trade for excellent battery endurance.",

        "review": "Very reasonable. Loud and clear! I mostly wear one at a time at work and one is good enough to hear music clearly and the outside noise. When both are in, I cant hear anything outside unless the volume is very low. Great earphones for the price. I would definitely purchase these again. As a matter of fact, I tried ordering 3 more pairs for Christmas gifts but the order was delayed and wouldn't arrive on time. I was unfortunately, forced to cancel. I'll try again after the New Year of 2026!",

        "review": "I purchased these based on a New York Times Wirecutter recommendation. I'm used to bone conducting headsets, so this form factor was different. They were a little awkward to put on, but only slightly - I likely would have gotten used to it in time. I appreciated that they had physical buttons, making it easy to play/pause, fast-forward and so on (although the buttons could be a little larger). It's not clear if there's a way to turn them off without putting them in the case. The intention is clearly to carry the case around with you at all times - a little awkward, as the case isn't tiny.These didn't interfere with my glasses and I had no significant issues with comfort for long-term wear, at least not from a couple days of use. (I'm practically always listening to podcasts and audiobooks, so I wear a Bluetooth headset all day long). Wearing them around other people may be off-putting: although these are open-ear headsets, so you can still hear normally, it LOOKS like you have headphones in your ears, so people may assume you aren't listening.My only major issue is battery life. The listing is proud to claim 45 hours of battery life... but that's talking about the charge in the case, not in the earpieces. Supposedly the earpieces should last 8 hours. I didn't measure it very scientifically, but my impression was that they lasted about 2-3 hours. Even if I'm wildly mistaken, they definitely wouldn't last more than 5 hours. So these are only useful if you're putting them in the case and letting them recharge multiple times a day. That's not how I use Bluetooth headsets: I leave them on all day so I can play audio anytime, and often for long periods of time. These are fine for a workout, but not for all-day use.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "These are currently my favorite headphones.  I'll highlight the pro's and few con's (because they are perfect) below...Pros:--Price.  I got these super cheap on sale (~$20).  From a quality and features standpoint, these headphones punch way above their class.--Super comfortable.  They are light but, more importantly, don't feel intrusive.  I love the open ear design.  Nothing is jammed in my ear resulting in zero fatigue, hot spots or swamp ear.  I have taken naps with them on (love being able to listen to music while napping).  Also, as someone who wears glasses, I love that there's no contact of any point between the headphones and glasses.  There's no feeling of pressure or the glasses sitting funny.--Physical buttons (especially at this price point).  I appreciate physical buttons over touch sensitivity.  It allows for precise execution of functions.-The accompanying app.  I think this feature separates these headphones from other low cost headphones.  I love that I'm able to select from different EQ setting to find one that best fits my tastes.  It can also be customized but my ears aren't that particular.  The ability to customize the button functions is also appreciated.--Sound.  To me, the sound quality is excellent overall.  The volume is loud enough against outside ambient noise while the open ear design allows me to hear my surroundings.  Couple with the EQ settings, my music sounds great.  With the volume down enough, I can also carry on conversations without having to remove them.--Fit.  They go with little fuss and stay on!  This allows me to enjoy my music while playing sports.  The only time they've moved out of place was when I accidentally hit them.Cons:--The Finding Headphone feature in the app.  It isn't completely useless as it will show the headphone's last active location but, the call L/R feature does not work unless they are out of the case and in use.  This lack of functionality caused me to think that I lost my headphones.  After replacing them with a different set of headphone that were on sale at the time (Soundcore V20i), they were found in my jacket pocket hanging in the closet at home lol.-Phone calls.  In louder settings, it was hard to hear my calls, even at maximum volume.  The mic, however, seemed fine as I have never gotten complaints.--Playtime (this is the main reason why I dropped a star).  I'm getting nowhere near the 7.5 hour playtime on a single charge.  I may be getting 5 hours at low to moderate volume.  For home use, this is totally fine as I'm constantly popping them on and off.  In the office, however, I would have them on all the time (because of the comfort).  Even though 15 minutes of charge will get me 2 more hours of play to get me through the rest of my work day, I opt to use the Soundcore V20i that I bought when I thought these were lost.  Although not as comfortable with glasses on, they last my entire work day.--Quality control.  This is more of a nit-pick, but the button on the right earpiece is more sunken in than the one on the left almost eliminating haptic feedback.  I can't tell when it's pressed.  This makes using it challenging enough to discourage me from using it.  I mainly use it to increase the volume but will use the phone instead (when it's with me).Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend them.  For the price, they are hard to beat.",

The BC1 clip on headphones solves this problem completely. Since they're open ear, they aren't noise-cancelling, but in return you get incredible comfort (nothing sticking in your ear canal) and most importantly, they don't fall out or move around. This design is genius. The sound is different, but I actually prefer it. There's a place for noise-cancelling earbuds (mowing the lawn), but the greater comfort far outweighs the benefit of noise cancellation in most situations. The sound itself is more natural and comfortable for TV viewing and other long listening situations, no ear fatigue. I've had zero issues with them so far, they are definitely my new favorite earbuds. For noise cancellation earbuds, I do prefer my Anker Soundcore2 over my BC1 Pro, though.",

        "review": "Took some time to get used to the feel of these as I've been using inner ear earbuds for years.  It was very easy to connect through bluetooth, the sound clarity on various tyes of music and podcasts are top notch.  I like that there are also specific buttons on the ear pieces so I can raise or lower volume, skip ahead, or take a call.  They're very comfortable and I don't get the constant usage itchiness from having something in my ear canal.  it clips onto my ear very easily with little broadcast \"speakers\" sitting outside my ear, they fit nicely and haven't moved to matter how much I may sweat.  i couldn't tell you the battery life yet but I've used them now for 3 days and as I take them out of the charging case they're still full of power.  The box says they're good for a totalk of 38 hours, if that isn't the case I'll edit my post, but it seems realisting.  At the sale price I got these for here on Amazon,. I'd say theis was an excellent value and the best purchase I've made this year so far. n",

They sit comfortably without pressing into the ear canal, so I can wear them for long periods without any pain or irritation. The open-ear design also makes it easy to stay aware of what\u2019s going on around me while still getting clear, balanced sound.They\u2019re lightweight, secure, and perfect for everyday use\u2014whether I\u2019m walking, working, or listening to something at home. If regular earbuds tend to hurt your ears, these are a wonderful alternative that still deliver really good audio quality.",

        "review": "These are currently my favorite headphones.  I'll highlight the pro's and few con's (because they are perfect) below...Pros:--Price.  I got these super cheap on sale (~$20).  From a quality and features standpoint, these headphones punch way above their class.--Super comfortable.  They are light but, more importantly, don't feel intrusive.  I love the open ear design.  Nothing is jammed in my ear resulting in zero fatigue, hot spots or swamp ear.  I have taken naps with them on (love being able to listen to music while napping).  Also, as someone who wears glasses, I love that there's no contact of any point between the headphones and glasses.  There's no feeling of pressure or the glasses sitting funny.--Physical buttons (especially at this price point).  I appreciate physical buttons over touch sensitivity.  It allows for precise execution of functions.-The accompanying app.  I think this feature separates these headphones from other low cost headphones.  I love that I'm able to select from different EQ setting to find one that best fits my tastes.  It can also be customized but my ears aren't that particular.  The ability to customize the button functions is also appreciated.--Sound.  To me, the sound quality is excellent overall.  The volume is loud enough against outside ambient noise while the open ear design allows me to hear my surroundings.  Couple with the EQ settings, my music sounds great.  With the volume down enough, I can also carry on conversations without having to remove them.--Fit.  They go with little fuss and stay on!  This allows me to enjoy my music while playing sports.  The only time they've moved out of place was when I accidentally hit them.Cons:--The Finding Headphone feature in the app.  It isn't completely useless as it will show the headphone's last active location but, the call L/R feature does not work unless they are out of the case and in use.  This lack of functionality caused me to think that I lost my headphones.  After replacing them with a different set of headphone that were on sale at the time (Soundcore V20i), they were found in my jacket pocket hanging in the closet at home lol.-Phone calls.  In louder settings, it was hard to hear my calls, even at maximum volume.  The mic, however, seemed fine as I have never gotten complaints.--Playtime (this is the main reason why I dropped a star).  I'm getting nowhere near the 7.5 hour playtime on a single charge.  I may be getting 5 hours at low to moderate volume.  For home use, this is totally fine as I'm constantly popping them on and off.  In the office, however, I would have them on all the time (because of the comfort).  Even though 15 minutes of charge will get me 2 more hours of play to get me through the rest of my work day, I opt to use the Soundcore V20i that I bought when I thought these were lost.  Although not as comfortable with glasses on, they last my entire work day.--Quality control.  This is more of a nit-pick, but the button on the right earpiece is more sunken in than the one on the left almost eliminating haptic feedback.  I can't tell when it's pressed.  This makes using it challenging enough to discourage me from using it.  I mainly use it to increase the volume but will use the phone instead (when it's with me).Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend them.  For the price, they are hard to beat.",

I've worn them sitting at my desk, walking around, and laying on my back and side while also wearing my CPAP mask. They stayed put every time. The sound quality is really impressive, particularly the bass. One thing I did notice was that sometimes a song will start playing on one bud before being picked up by the other one. Thought that was a little weird, but that might've been caused by my phone or the app I was streaming from at the time. I haven't made many calls with the headphones yet but I did demo the mic for a friend via a Whatsapp message.

The music/cinema functions make listening to my audiobooks and music night and day!! On my Huawei, these features barely made any difference with the incredibly quiet audio. (You do have to reset this feature every time you use the buds, but I would need to switch between them anyway, so it isn't much of a bother). The custom EQ also made the audio quality much better than what you get straight out of the box! The Huaweis have a higher quality build and technically crisper audio, but they are so quiet it often barely matters. Because the Baseus are louder, they leak audio a bit more, but it's very minor, and in the settings I use them, it is not an issue. Frankly, I believe the Bluetooth connection is better than my Huaweis. When I step out of range they automatically reconnect, whereas I have to manually reconnect my Huaweis. One complaint I have is that the magnets keeping the case shut are very weak and pop open with a gentle brush against something. However, the magnets keeping the earbuds secure are solid and thus have yet to cause any fallage. It mostly causes an issue when it pops open in my bag and steals my audio or calls, but again, very worth it for the price.

And I don't know if only the right one is for phone calls but ONLY my right one works for phone calls, left one does not, I would not recommend these.UPDATE. 11/08/05After the possibly defective product, Hana from Baseus customer service reached out to me apologized for my bad experience, gave me a full refund then offered me an UPGRADED PAIR absolutely free of charge!! Free shipping included, tried them and I'm impressed with the build quality, but more so the sound, they sound very good, with good volume and good and quick connectivity, These are actually way , way better than the Monsters I purchased in sound quality. Some of the best and friendly customers service I've experienced here on Amazon, I could now say I highly recommend the Baseus MC1, you will not regret it!! Oh and if you do get a defective pair. do not worry THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. Thank you Hana from BASEUS.",

        "review": "These are actually surprisingly nice. To be clear, I ordered them because they were cheap and it's nice to have a set in my car for when I'm stuck waiting at a doctors appointment or something. When I ordered them I did not notice they were \"open ear\" fit. Unlike most headphones of this type they do not actually have a rubber earbud tip that goes in your ear. These are actually just a speaker that sits over your ear. At first this struck me as a cheap design meant to cut costs but this is actually surprisingly pleasant. I feel they are more comfortable. The ear buds that go in my ear can be irritating after wearing them a while. These you almost forget your wearing. I like that they do not completely block out other sounds around you so can hear whats going on around you. Now you might say well but I don't want to hear all the noise around me I want to hear what I'm listening too! Because the speakers are physically over your ear they do block outside sounds notably just not as completely as say a conventional earbud does. I can still hear when someone calls my name or when the alarm on my cook timer goes off but outside sounds are not so much such that  I find it disruptive to what I am listening to. I also love the Bluetooth connection reliability! I'm not sure what the honest range is because I've worn these around the house while my phone was left on the charger and never had the connection break up. I've tested it at least 20-30 feet through walls in other rooms. That's pretty good by my experience with cheap earbuds. The only thing I do not like is the charge indicator on the base unit. It's just a single LED that blinks. There is no percentage bar or battery life indicator. It could be nearly dead or mostly charged I have no idea. This is particularly bad as the batteries for the base are kind of small and it has left me with dead headphones and a dead base that wasn't charging them unknown to me. I also kind of hate the case. It's kind of oval shaped and the top half has a ridge you can grip onto to open the lid but the lower half is curved and smooth leaving you nothing to grip onto. It's unnecessarily difficult and annoying to open and has caused me to drop it several times. For the money I think they are great. They fit well, they sound good, they are cheap, reliable. They represent a great value and I have bought a few pairs just to wear around the house while I'm doing chores or take to work.EDIT: So there is one more thing I want to add to these. I live in a colder climate and typically when I have to shovel snow I like to put in earbuds on so I can listen to something while I work. The problem is I also have to wear a hat that covers my ears to keep warm. Because the elastic puts pressure on the earbuds the classical style earbud gets jammed into my ear canal and is very uncomfortable borderline painful. I either have to take the earbuds out or wear my hat so it doesn't cover my ears which is at best uncomfortably cold and at worst leaves me vulnerable to frostbite, no joke or exaggeration there. These earbuds that just have speakers over the ear and do not actually go into the ear canal can be comfortably worn with a winter hat fully covering my ear. This is a HUGE benefit for poor souls like me who have to work outside in cold climates. Again this seemed like a cheap design at first but I'm increasingly finding I actually like it a lot better than the classic earbud design.",

        "review": "I've had mixed experiences with Baseus earphones before; I usually love them but find them to be less durable than I'd like.In this case, knock on wood, not only have I found the sound good and the battery life excellent, they've held up very well to extended use in sweaty conditions. Unlike earbuds that get inserted into the ear, I'm a lot less likely to wind up fostering an ear infection or winding up with part of an earbud stuck in my ear.These are also very comfortable. Eventually, I do need to adjust them, but I can forget I'm wearing them for an hour or more. They're very light.I love that they're USBC and charge with the same charger as my other devices. The case has additional battery that adds an extra couple of sessions of charging in reserve.If there's one thing I'd change, I find it hard to open the charging case sometimes. This isn't a big design issue, but it could use a slightly larger lip for people with short nails to use to open the case.",

The new case is difficult to grip to open.  Sound while decently loud and balanced has no app you can use to change the sound profile... Pretty much in every area this is a downgrade from the earlier model (Eli sport 1).  If you're okay with those faults these are a good little set of over the ear earbuds, especially for the price.",

Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

I was a little skeptical at first just from the clip on design itself and the fact that most clipons ive tried have left me feeling disappointed. But these are an absolute MUST buy for anyone looking for a clip on.The sound is awesome, at low volume (30% or so) they do a great job of still being clearly audible and having a bass that is still present. Once you crank it up to 70-80 they definitely pump out some nice sound. Top that off with the nice soft rubber grips and a sturdy fit you have yourself not only a comfortable earbud but a great WORKOUT earbud.The battery life is good as well, i went a whole session with volume at about 60% and got almost 9 hours from them which is insane. The button on each earbud can be customized with many options to choose from which is nice too. I haven't necessarily used them for calls specifically but ended up using them on a discord call and got zero complaints so i assume they must be fine as well.Overall these are easy to recommend for anyone interested in clip ons and especially as a gift option.",

        "review": "I just purchased these Baseus open ear buds to replace my old Jlab ones. So far they are great. I primarily use them for music listening while still being able to pick up outside sounds and keep mobile. The Bose bass sounds excellent with no distortion. They are lightweight and comfortable with thoughtful little rubber nubs where they come in contact with your ears. Buttons work fine. I personally like the open ear ring type buds. They look like some kind of cyber-tribal piercing thing, which works for me. I still wish they\u2019d invent an accessory miniature subwoofer that clips into your nostrils through.Update 12/25: After a couple of months I\u2019m still liken\u2019 these ear bud. My only issues are the little control buttons. The \u2018feel\u2019 of the buttons when pressed doesn\u2019t do it for me. It\u2019s hard to tell when you\u2019re activating a command. I have a feeling these will not last  in prolonged use. Also the buttons would be better bigger and maybe knurled rubber caps for easier use. I should also mention that the charger case is horrible. It\u2019s larger than the cheaper Jlab one that this replaced and very, very difficult to open. It needs a recessed finger groove or something.",

Their sound, battery, controls, feel, fit, and in app support is all very solid.Let\u2019s start with the pros.Sound quality is clean with an emphasis on the low and on highs, so a bit of a V Shape tuning. The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn\u2019t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price. I love the magnet on them since Baseus products usually have a strong magnet to them.Now for the cons.Sound quality is great, superb even, but the classics bass thump is lacking a bit. I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn\u2019t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have. The XH1\u2019s have it, and so it was mildly surprising to see these didn\u2019t have it.Fit is good, but it could definitely be better. With light use and not as heavy a move, they wouldn\u2019t fall out, but if I were to exercise, these would most likely slip. The limited use of 3 eartips definitely does not help.App Support could also be better. The Dolby Audio isn\u2019t the best and custom EQ doesn\u2019t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from. They sound quieter and a bit more flat. Also, as mentioned the above, the lack of bass boost button is upsetting.Overall, my experience with these have been positive so far and will keep testing them out.",

        "review": "Looking for the ultimate escape into your own world of sound? Look no further than the Baseus Bowie 30 Max Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. These sleek, over-the-ear headphones deliver unparalleled audio quality and immersive experiences, especially with the addition of Spatial Audio.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83c\udfa7Sound\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced. The Bowie 30 Max are quickly becoming my favorite. They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max. They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp. The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use, while the Bowie 30 Max still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Spatial Audio with Head Tracking\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaWhat sets these headphones apart is their Spatial Audio feature, which takes your listening experience to the next level. Feel like you're right in the middle of the action, with sound that surrounds you in all directions, adding depth and dimension to your favorite content. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment. (Same as Bose QC Ultra, Airpods Max)\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83c\udfa7Noise Cancelling\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5I would say, at $99 ANC definetly worth the price. For the low-frequency noises, you know the annoying engine sound, it does the job same as Bose on airplanes! But for the higher frequency noises like people talking, I think it is above average, better than good but not Sony/Bose level. The one thing about the Bose/Sony is their ability to block ambient noise adaptively, but Bowie 30 Max only takes a 1/4 price of them, probably 1/5 with a coupon or a deal.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83c\udfa7Comfort\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight. I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they\u2019re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time. I don\u2019t work out, but I would imagine they\u2019d maintain their fit during exercise.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Battery Life\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaThe battery life is super incredible and lasts like a full week if you were to use these all day everyday. I\u2019ve had these only like two weeks and I\u2019ve only charged it twice but I use these alot. I think I average about 3-4 hours a day wearing these during the week, and usually charge them once a week, but I don't let them get super low either. Charge super fast, 10 mins for 14 hours of use is just ridiculous.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83c\udfa7Multi-point Connectivity\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45\u2019s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone. The XM5\u2019s require using the app, the Sonos don\u2019t do it as easily as advertised and the AirPods Max don\u2019t even offer multipoint functionality.\ud83c\udfa7If you\u2019re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the Bowie 30 Max over all the others I mentioned, even if they cost more than $99. I hope that helps. Happy Listening!\ud83c\udfa7",

These sleek, over-the-ear headphones deliver unparalleled audio quality and immersive experiences, especially with the addition of Spatial Audio.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83c\udfa7Sound\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced. The Bowie 30 Max are quickly becoming my favorite. They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max. They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp. The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use, while the Bowie 30 Max still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Spatial Audio with Head Tracking\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaWhat sets these headphones apart is their Spatial Audio feature, which takes your listening experience to the next level. Feel like you're right in the middle of the action, with sound that surrounds you in all directions, adding depth and dimension to your favorite content. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment. (Same as Bose QC Ultra, Airpods Max)\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83c\udfa7Noise Cancelling\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5I would say, at $99 ANC definetly worth the price. For the low-frequency noises, you know the annoying engine sound, it does the job same as Bose on airplanes! But for the higher frequency noises like people talking, I think it is above average, better than good but not Sony/Bose level. The one thing about the Bose/Sony is their ability to block ambient noise adaptively, but Bowie 30 Max only takes a 1/4 price of them, probably 1/5 with a coupon or a deal.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83c\udfa7Comfort\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight. I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they\u2019re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time. I don\u2019t work out, but I would imagine they\u2019d maintain their fit during exercise.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83c\udfa7Battery Life\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfeaThe battery life is super incredible and lasts like a full week if you were to use these all day everyday. I\u2019ve had these only like two weeks and I\u2019ve only charged it twice but I use these alot. I think I average about 3-4 hours a day wearing these during the week, and usually charge them once a week, but I don't let them get super low either. Charge super fast, 10 mins for 14 hours of use is just ridiculous.\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83c\udfa7Multi-point Connectivity\ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfea\ud83d\udfeb\ud83d\udfe5\ud83d\udfe7\ud83d\udfe8They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45\u2019s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone. The XM5\u2019s require using the app, the Sonos don\u2019t do it as easily as advertised and the AirPods Max don\u2019t even offer multipoint functionality.\ud83c\udfa7If you\u2019re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the Bowie 30 Max over all the others I mentioned, even if they cost more than $99. I hope that helps. Happy Listening!\ud83c\udfa7",

        "review": "Was looking for earbuds that felt secure on my ears while I moved around, something I found lacking in the more traditional design. These seemed like a good-quality product at a reasonable price and I'm happy to report that I wasn't disappointed. Setup took less than a minute, and the battery's been impressive, have only charged the case once since I got it last Friday. The buds themselves are very comfortable on the ear. I've worn them sitting at my desk, walking around, and laying on my back and side while also wearing my CPAP mask. They stayed put every time. The sound quality is really impressive, particularly the bass. One thing I did notice was that sometimes a song will start playing on one bud before being picked up by the other one. Thought that was a little weird, but that might've been caused by my phone or the app I was streaming from at the time. I haven't made many calls with the headphones yet but I did demo the mic for a friend via a Whatsapp message. Listening back, both she and I found it to be a bit lacking in clarity, but that might also have been an issue with my connection. Overall, I like these earbuds a lot and look forward to our travels together.",

        "review": "These are actually surprisingly nice. To be clear, I ordered them because they were cheap and it's nice to have a set in my car for when I'm stuck waiting at a doctors appointment or something. When I ordered them I did not notice they were \"open ear\" fit. Unlike most headphones of this type they do not actually have a rubber earbud tip that goes in your ear. These are actually just a speaker that sits over your ear. At first this struck me as a cheap design meant to cut costs but this is actually surprisingly pleasant. I feel they are more comfortable. The ear buds that go in my ear can be irritating after wearing them a while. These you almost forget your wearing. I like that they do not completely block out other sounds around you so can hear whats going on around you. Now you might say well but I don't want to hear all the noise around me I want to hear what I'm listening too! Because the speakers are physically over your ear they do block outside sounds notably just not as completely as say a conventional earbud does. I can still hear when someone calls my name or when the alarm on my cook timer goes off but outside sounds are not so much such that  I find it disruptive to what I am listening to. I also love the Bluetooth connection reliability! I'm not sure what the honest range is because I've worn these around the house while my phone was left on the charger and never had the connection break up. I've tested it at least 20-30 feet through walls in other rooms. That's pretty good by my experience with cheap earbuds. The only thing I do not like is the charge indicator on the base unit. It's just a single LED that blinks. There is no percentage bar or battery life indicator. It could be nearly dead or mostly charged I have no idea. This is particularly bad as the batteries for the base are kind of small and it has left me with dead headphones and a dead base that wasn't charging them unknown to me. I also kind of hate the case. It's kind of oval shaped and the top half has a ridge you can grip onto to open the lid but the lower half is curved and smooth leaving you nothing to grip onto. It's unnecessarily difficult and annoying to open and has caused me to drop it several times. For the money I think they are great. They fit well, they sound good, they are cheap, reliable. They represent a great value and I have bought a few pairs just to wear around the house while I'm doing chores or take to work.EDIT: So there is one more thing I want to add to these. I live in a colder climate and typically when I have to shovel snow I like to put in earbuds on so I can listen to something while I work. The problem is I also have to wear a hat that covers my ears to keep warm. Because the elastic puts pressure on the earbuds the classical style earbud gets jammed into my ear canal and is very uncomfortable borderline painful. I either have to take the earbuds out or wear my hat so it doesn't cover my ears which is at best uncomfortably cold and at worst leaves me vulnerable to frostbite, no joke or exaggeration there. These earbuds that just have speakers over the ear and do not actually go into the ear canal can be comfortably worn with a winter hat fully covering my ear. This is a HUGE benefit for poor souls like me who have to work outside in cold climates. Again this seemed like a cheap design at first but I'm increasingly finding I actually like it a lot better than the classic earbud design.",

Unlike earbuds that get inserted into the ear, I'm a lot less likely to wind up fostering an ear infection or winding up with part of an earbud stuck in my ear.These are also very comfortable. Eventually, I do need to adjust them, but I can forget I'm wearing them for an hour or more. They're very light.I love that they're USBC and charge with the same charger as my other devices. The case has additional battery that adds an extra couple of sessions of charging in reserve.If there's one thing I'd change, I find it hard to open the charging case sometimes. This isn't a big design issue, but it could use a slightly larger lip for people with short nails to use to open the case.",

I am a huge fan of brands that offer their customers high quality items without having a huge price tag, and I respect these brands as long as they keep pumping out high quality items.These earbuds are extremely loud, the sound is 10/10, it feels like I'm listening out of a high quality stereo speaker phone that is in my ear. I love that these DO NOT have touch control, because it makes it easier to use during rain or shower, which I did do today. I wore these in the shower and the sound remained 10/10, something that no other earbud I ever owned was able to achieve. No muffled sound, no loss in quality, absolutely amazing in water.Also, the bass is pretty useless in this, but it doesnt matter too much because the sound quality makes up for it 100 percent.The battery life is good, I've been wearing them all day and they have a very premium build quality.The only thing I prefer, is more tighter or smaller rings, also I am unsure on how long the rubber parts will last. Other than these two worries, this is a 10/10 device and I am recommending them to everyone, and the app is so intuitive.",

I would like to listen to music during work out, the old style earbuds are easy to get wet and slip out. But the function of this one is supper fit for exercise.The sound quality is just as good as in ear product. The price is very valuable for the good quality!",

        "review": "Disappointed. The sound quality is nominal--nothing spectacular--particularly the bass. Enhanced or not the bass is barely noticeable. The app gave it a little boost but if you are an audiophile and you want them for music, don't bother. The  FF/Next feature and the Previous feature do not work as tapping only results in Volume Control and Pause and Play regardless to the number of taps/beeps. I would surmise that although it is comfortable, it is not suited to all ear sizes because the \"speaker\" does not position itself in the same spot on every ear. For the price, I will be returning these.",

Soundfit actually adjusts the headphone sound to the sound frequencies as you hear then! Once Soundfit works its magic, test the headphones to your favorite music or movie.

The controls are physical and easy to use and can be adjusted via the app, which also allows you to equalize the sound to your liking or choose between the Sound by Bose (my favorite setting), Dolby or extra Bass, or any other of the aound presets.Wireless connectivity is great and I had no issues with calls. They are comfortable and fit alright to my head. They seem well built and are heavy compared to good headphones like the $30 Tozo HT2. As fir durability, time will tell.

So I bought Bose Ultra open buds and Shokz open fit buds. Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth. In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it. I finally decided to see if there was a better alternative and stumbled upon these Baseus Bowie MC1 clip earbuds, which seemed like they could be the answer.\u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9cPro\u2019s:The fit is excellent, the sound is excellent, the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable. When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears. The sound was good when I was running.The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market. For me and my ears, the Baseus is an excellent buy. These are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the Baseus really improved. I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with. I still like the Baseus ear clip design vs the earhook. So which do I prefer. Running and exercising-Baseus without a doubt.Bose Ultra is too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds. They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting. Should be priced around the Soundcore and Shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end. For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity. Most of all a larger and louder volume level. I\u2019m returning them. My Baseus Bowie MC1 do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.

My ears are small so this could be different for different ear sizes. The sound quality is premium and you can move it a bit to find the right spot for best sound.\ud83d\udc9a4) Call quality is good. I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside\ud83d\udc996) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music.\ud83d\udc9c7) Baseus app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available.\u27648) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life.

Build quality is good too.  Overall I really like them and plan to keep them.HOWEVER, after a week of use, I realize the ear buds mic will stop working either when I walk away from my laptop like going to bathroom or kitchen.  It seems the disconnection is random to me.  I am not sure it's because of distance or period of not streaming.  But the worst is the mic will not work properly even the earbuds reconnect with my laptop.  I HAVE to unpair and repair the earbuds with my laptop.  As I use this earbuds for work from home meetings, this random disconnection / malfunction of mic is such a pain that finally I decided to return the earbuds.  It is such a shame.  I did see one another user commented the same issue but I thought that was random.  But in my case, it happens pretty much everyday.... so if you want to use this earbuds for meetings, be careful.

I did not face any issues during the call while I was walking outside\ud83d\udc996) You can hear the surroundings while outside, although some level of noise is reduced so that you enjoy the music.\ud83d\udc9c7) Baseus app enables you to: pair the device with your phone, calibrating the earbuds so that you get good sound quality, selecting the equalizer (bass, mid-range, treble) is available.\u27648) The charging case is small and pocketable with good battery life. Up to 9-10 hours of play time and up to an extra 31 hours of battery life in the charging case.",

        "review": "I bought these as a second round choice to some JBL earpods I initially purchased and ended up returning immediately.The JBL earpods would not consistently stay in my ear no matter the provided ear adapter I tried.I was originally hesitant about buying these \"clip-on\" style ones as a replacement.But after trying them out I was extremely satisfied.They are super lightweight, comfortable, and STAY in place no matter how hard I seem to move or shake my head.I have worn them doing sweaty rough yardwork with no issues at all.Sound/volume might vary a tiny bit depending where the speaker sits in your ear once clipped on.And like all earpods, you don't get the same bass as over-ear headphones...However I think these have all around good sound and listen to rock/metal, EDM, rap, podcasts, etc on them.Charging is quick and easy.Connection/pairing seems to work extremely well and is very seamless placing in/out of the case.Range seems comparable to larger headphones.I would give them 4 1/2 stars, knocking half a star off for better bass (if possible in such a compact package).",

They stay on, I hear great through them, they hold a charge a really long time (probably about 8 hours of straight use) and the case holds a charge for about a week. They are lightweight and comfortable. A little bit of trouble with phone calls sometimes, but other times it\u2019s fine, so it could be another issue. I love them so much!!!",

It has really good sound quality, the battery is great, the design it\u2019s cute. The only thing i don\u2019t like the size it\u2019s a bit big for my ear but they are great and comfortable.

        "review": "First of all, I really love this open ear earbuds.  They are very comfortable, loose but still secure.  Sound is good enough, including some level of bass. Build quality is good too.  Overall I really like them and plan to keep them.HOWEVER, after a week of use, I realize the ear buds mic will stop working either when I walk away from my laptop like going to bathroom or kitchen.  It seems the disconnection is random to me.  I am not sure it's because of distance or period of not streaming.  But the worst is the mic will not work properly even the earbuds reconnect with my laptop.  I HAVE to unpair and repair the earbuds with my laptop.  As I use this earbuds for work from home meetings, this random disconnection / malfunction of mic is such a pain that finally I decided to return the earbuds.  It is such a shame.  I did see one another user commented the same issue but I thought that was random.  But in my case, it happens pretty much everyday.... so if you want to use this earbuds for meetings, be careful.  Otherwise this earbuds is almost perfect for me.",

(in case this review is lumped together with other models they sell)They sound great in quiet environments because the overall output levels can't get very loud, made worse by lower bass response than many other open ear designs.In a quiet environment they have a very clean output that sounds pretty good if you aren't playing anything with much low frequency content.  I don't mean it doesn't match basshead expectations, I mean there's country music that you will be disappointed with the lack of strong bass.  It gets more disappointing if you specifically listen to decaf/rebassed tracks or anything that plays below about 32Hz... levels roll off pretty quickly below that, being absent below 22 or 23Hz.Pressing the open ear transducers to close off the open ear gap doesn't help much.  They are about as good as they are gonna get in their natural positions.They are good for most music.Their bluetooth range is pretty impressive.Battery endurance is super good due to truncated bass response below about 30Hz.  Usually I am seeing 12-14 hours on a single full charge, running down to 15-20% remaining.  This is a mix of music, YouTube, calls, and idle time in my work day.Comfort is really good: I can put them over my ears at 7AM and take them off at 9PM without ear fatigue or discomfort.  That beats my AfterShokz models which are bone conduction for comfort, though sound clarity is superior with these Baseus headphones.A breeze above 15mph makes phone calls disappointing, but below that or indoors they are actually great for calls.I will be buying a different set in the near future and giving these to a friend that mostly stays indoors.  Not for me, as I spend a lot of time outside in a windy state.I tried all supported Codecs, and leave them connected by LDAC or AptX HD.  These are good enough to tell the difference between higher bit rate codecs and SBC easily.My biggest issue is that they don't get loud enough for use in a noisy city street, and secondary they roll off the bass output above the bottom end of typical modern country, R&B, or Hip Hop music tracks.I am not looking for extra bass, only balanced bass that accurately plays evenly down to what an organ or bass drum should sound like.So, tldr: good soundfield recreation if you are okay with truncated bass spectrum and lower total output in trade for excellent battery endurance.",

        "review": "I'm a big fan of Baseus earbuds. These things are amazing. I gave my last one to my elderly uncle who refuses to get a hearing aid... These are pretty loud and don't crack on high volume. The bass is pretty good given they're open ear.. they're extremely comfortable and very light weight. Battery life is long enough to last all night.. I sleep with them on.",

        "review": "This review is for Baseus Eli Sport 2 Open-ear Headphones. (in case this review is lumped together with other models they sell)They sound great in quiet environments because the overall output levels can't get very loud, made worse by lower bass response than many other open ear designs.In a quiet environment they have a very clean output that sounds pretty good if you aren't playing anything with much low frequency content.  I don't mean it doesn't match basshead expectations, I mean there's country music that you will be disappointed with the lack of strong bass.  It gets more disappointing if you specifically listen to decaf/rebassed tracks or anything that plays below about 32Hz... levels roll off pretty quickly below that, being absent below 22 or 23Hz.Pressing the open ear transducers to close off the open ear gap doesn't help much.  They are about as good as they are gonna get in their natural positions.They are good for most music.Their bluetooth range is pretty impressive.Battery endurance is super good due to truncated bass response below about 30Hz.  Usually I am seeing 12-14 hours on a single full charge, running down to 15-20% remaining.  This is a mix of music, YouTube, calls, and idle time in my work day.Comfort is really good: I can put them over my ears at 7AM and take them off at 9PM without ear fatigue or discomfort.  That beats my AfterShokz models which are bone conduction for comfort, though sound clarity is superior with these Baseus headphones.A breeze above 15mph makes phone calls disappointing, but below that or indoors they are actually great for calls.I will be buying a different set in the near future and giving these to a friend that mostly stays indoors.  Not for me, as I spend a lot of time outside in a windy state.I tried all supported Codecs, and leave them connected by LDAC or AptX HD.  These are good enough to tell the difference between higher bit rate codecs and SBC easily.My biggest issue is that they don't get loud enough for use in a noisy city street, and secondary they roll off the bass output above the bottom end of typical modern country, R&B, or Hip Hop music tracks.I am not looking for extra bass, only balanced bass that accurately plays evenly down to what an organ or bass drum should sound like.So, tldr: good soundfield recreation if you are okay with truncated bass spectrum and lower total output in trade for excellent battery endurance.",

        "review": "Very reasonable. Loud and clear! I mostly wear one at a time at work and one is good enough to hear music clearly and the outside noise. When both are in, I cant hear anything outside unless the volume is very low. Great earphones for the price. I would definitely purchase these again. As a matter of fact, I tried ordering 3 more pairs for Christmas gifts but the order was delayed and wouldn't arrive on time. I was unfortunately, forced to cancel. I'll try again after the New Year of 2026!",

        "review": "I purchased these based on a New York Times Wirecutter recommendation. I'm used to bone conducting headsets, so this form factor was different. They were a little awkward to put on, but only slightly - I likely would have gotten used to it in time. I appreciated that they had physical buttons, making it easy to play/pause, fast-forward and so on (although the buttons could be a little larger). It's not clear if there's a way to turn them off without putting them in the case. The intention is clearly to carry the case around with you at all times - a little awkward, as the case isn't tiny.These didn't interfere with my glasses and I had no significant issues with comfort for long-term wear, at least not from a couple days of use. (I'm practically always listening to podcasts and audiobooks, so I wear a Bluetooth headset all day long). Wearing them around other people may be off-putting: although these are open-ear headsets, so you can still hear normally, it LOOKS like you have headphones in your ears, so people may assume you aren't listening.My only major issue is battery life. The listing is proud to claim 45 hours of battery life... but that's talking about the charge in the case, not in the earpieces. Supposedly the earpieces should last 8 hours. I didn't measure it very scientifically, but my impression was that they lasted about 2-3 hours. Even if I'm wildly mistaken, they definitely wouldn't last more than 5 hours. So these are only useful if you're putting them in the case and letting them recharge multiple times a day. That's not how I use Bluetooth headsets: I leave them on all day so I can play audio anytime, and often for long periods of time. These are fine for a workout, but not for all-day use.",
