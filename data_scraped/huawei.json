        "review": "I gave these a good run through and have some thoughts. I'll start with the negatives. First, these do not sound great for music. It doesn't matter how I've EQ'ed them, I could never get the bass to a level I liked. These are mainly heavy on the highs with a lack of detail in the mids. Their sound signature, even after EQ'ing, works well for calls but didn't sound great with music or music-heavy movies. Second, Lenovo doesn't make an app for Android, iOS, macOS, or anything other than Windows. You must download Lenovo's Windows app to update their firmware, adjust settings, and EQ them. Third, their touch controls are limited. There\u2019s a glossy strip on the earbuds that seem like they\u2019d be great for volume controls, but they only have basic tap controls that are wonky. Fourth, Atmos sounds terrible. Like every other company that tries to upscale stereo audio to faux surround sound, the results are awful sounding, and I left Atmos off. Lastly, their ANC is on par with $40 earbuds from competing brands. It\u2019s nice that Lenovo offers ANC, but it isn\u2019t anything to write home about and it had issues with my space heater, something earbuds from other companies (even at $40) had no issues cancelling out.Despite these negatives, there are a few positives that make these a solid purchase for PC use. They maintain a solid connection to my Lenovo and Dell PCs. I could stay within a 10ft radius without experiencing dropouts or skips, even when in Teams meetings. I didn\u2019t have anyone complain about microphone quality or other issues. The microphone tech here was able to cancel out the space heater in my office along with other low office noises.Latency was low enough I could watch training videos and other videos without having lip sync delays. My Lenovo has Bluetooth 5.3, but my work-issued Dell system has Bluetooth 5.1 and latency was still low with it. Lenovo\u2019s app is easy to use once you get it installed, and it always connects to the earbuds without issues. The EQ was easy to adjust from a list of pre-sets or a simple band EQ you can adjust. Like I said, I could never get the bass levels I wanted or clarity in the highs, but having an EQ is better than not (I\u2019m looking at you, Apple).The case doesn\u2019t have Qi charging, I wish it would, but USB C charging was quick. These earbuds were getting me about 5 hours of use with ANC on, Lenovo advertises up 7 hours without ANC enabled. Much to my surprise, these earbuds feature wear detection. It\u2019s a simple light sensor, but it works. Take one earbud out while playing content and it will pause. You can use the earbuds independently as well.Overall, these aren\u2019t bad if you\u2019re looking for a pair of inexpensive earbuds to use for Teams meetings. They aren\u2019t great for music or movies, but they\u2019re still serviceable. These excel with calls and meetings while providing a solid connection to Windows PCs during Teams meetings, something other earbuds have issues with. I don\u2019t recommend these for media consumption, but they are great \u201cbusiness\u201d earbuds to get work done.",

The sound quality is clear, rich, and powerful, with immersive spatial audio and excellent real-time adaptive noise cancelling. They fit comfortably in my ears, even during long listening sessions, and feel secure without causing discomfort.I\u2019ve used Apple AirPods for years, but these earbuds have easily become my favorite. The Hi-Res sound, long 50-hour battery life, fast charging, and IP55 water resistance make them perfect for everyday use. Bluetooth connectivity is smooth, and the added translation feature is a great bonus.For the price, the quality is outstanding\u2014easily one of the best values I\u2019ve experienced in wireless earbuds.

        "review": "I gave these a good run through and have some thoughts. I'll start with the negatives. First, these do not sound great for music. It doesn't matter how I've EQ'ed them, I could never get the bass to a level I liked. These are mainly heavy on the highs with a lack of detail in the mids. Their sound signature, even after EQ'ing, works well for calls but didn't sound great with music or music-heavy movies. Second, Lenovo doesn't make an app for Android, iOS, macOS, or anything other than Windows. You must download Lenovo's Windows app to update their firmware, adjust settings, and EQ them. Third, their touch controls are limited. There\u2019s a glossy strip on the earbuds that seem like they\u2019d be great for volume controls, but they only have basic tap controls that are wonky. Fourth, Atmos sounds terrible. Like every other company that tries to upscale stereo audio to faux surround sound, the results are awful sounding, and I left Atmos off. Lastly, their ANC is on par with $40 earbuds from competing brands. It\u2019s nice that Lenovo offers ANC, but it isn\u2019t anything to write home about and it had issues with my space heater, something earbuds from other companies (even at $40) had no issues cancelling out.Despite these negatives, there are a few positives that make these a solid purchase for PC use. They maintain a solid connection to my Lenovo and Dell PCs. I could stay within a 10ft radius without experiencing dropouts or skips, even when in Teams meetings. I didn\u2019t have anyone complain about microphone quality or other issues. The microphone tech here was able to cancel out the space heater in my office along with other low office noises.Latency was low enough I could watch training videos and other videos without having lip sync delays. My Lenovo has Bluetooth 5.3, but my work-issued Dell system has Bluetooth 5.1 and latency was still low with it. Lenovo\u2019s app is easy to use once you get it installed, and it always connects to the earbuds without issues. The EQ was easy to adjust from a list of pre-sets or a simple band EQ you can adjust. Like I said, I could never get the bass levels I wanted or clarity in the highs, but having an EQ is better than not (I\u2019m looking at you, Apple).The case doesn\u2019t have Qi charging, I wish it would, but USB C charging was quick. These earbuds were getting me about 5 hours of use with ANC on, Lenovo advertises up 7 hours without ANC enabled. Much to my surprise, these earbuds feature wear detection. It\u2019s a simple light sensor, but it works. Take one earbud out while playing content and it will pause. You can use the earbuds independently as well.Overall, these aren\u2019t bad if you\u2019re looking for a pair of inexpensive earbuds to use for Teams meetings. They aren\u2019t great for music or movies, but they\u2019re still serviceable. These excel with calls and meetings while providing a solid connection to Windows PCs during Teams meetings, something other earbuds have issues with. I don\u2019t recommend these for media consumption, but they are great \u201cbusiness\u201d earbuds to get work done.",

        "review": "I got these because of my laptop and initially I thought they were good headphones/earbuds for like the first week but it has been a nightmare to use these. I can only get one or the other side to connect to blue tooth. I finally fixed that and got both sides to sync together and connect to Bluetooth and within less than a week it went back to me only been able to hear from one ear bud at a time. I am not connecting it to other devices!!!! It should not be so challenging to reset the earbuds and get them both synced up and they should not revert back to only one ear bud working at time. I wish I would have returned them during the time frame to get refund or replacement but snoozed off hoping to fix them. I am disappointed. I have spent too many hours trying to resolve this and when I did it went back to not functioning as intended within days.",

They\u2019re super comfortable and easy to use.I especially like that I can connect them to both my phone and my computer at the same time.When I\u2019m watching something on my laptop and someone calls me, the earbuds automatically switch to the phone.

I could never figure out how to control noise cancellation vs pass through audio.",

        "review": "I really wanted to like these earbuds.  They are a nice color, not the usual black.  The case is well made, though I would have liked a feel that was less slick, and a squared off base so it could set up on my desk.  They last about 4 hours listening to videos and audio books.  I am not one to use noise cancelling, I like to hear what is going on around me, but I did test it and there was a significant reduction in the noise in my office.  The instructions were a little lacking, there were pictures that told how to turn the earbuds and noise cancelling on/off.  I can supposedly register the earbuds, but do not see the serial number, and the only QR code on the box does not scan with my phone.  There was also mention of an app for further adjustments and updates to the earbuds, but after much searching I found it is an app for a computer, not cellphone.  This is very disappointing since I would be primarily using them at work and cannot download an app to my work computer.  After trying them out at work for 8 hours (you can use 1 bud at a time), I found them uncomfortable.  They fit very similarly to the newer apple buds, which I can't wear for the same reason.  The sound was ok.  With lower voices I didn't notice any issues, but the audio book I was listening to has a female narrator, and sounded a little tinny.  The app is supposed to allow you to make adjustments, but I cannot verify that.",

The fit is incredibly secure, I was impressed by how comfortably they hook over my ears. Even when I tested them with some vigorous head movements, they didn\u2019t budge at all. Audio quality is excellent; I streamed a few videos and the sound came through crystal clear. For the price point, these are an outstanding value.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

From the moment I put them on, the fit was secure and comfortable \u2014 they stay in place even during long workouts and runs. The Bluetooth 5.4 connection is solid and quick to pair with my phone, and I\u2019ve experienced zero dropouts so far.The sound quality is impressive for the price point \u2014 rich bass, clear highs, and surprisingly good overall balance. I also love the 80+ hour battery life, which means I can go days between charges without any stress. The waterproof rating gives me confidence to wear them during sweaty gym sessions or in light rain.Touch controls are intuitive and responsive, and the LED display on the case is a nice bonus. Overall, these have outperformed my expectations and feel like a much more expensive pair of earbuds. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for reliable, great-sounding wireless earbuds!",

The comfortable silicone ear hooks solve the problem of losing earbuds. These earbuds have a high quality sound, especially at this price point. The battery life is also much longer than the AirPods. The  noise cancellation feature is really nice to have, again at this price point.",

        "review": "I gave these a good run through and have some thoughts. I'll start with the negatives. First, these do not sound great for music. It doesn't matter how I've EQ'ed them, I could never get the bass to a level I liked. These are mainly heavy on the highs with a lack of detail in the mids. Their sound signature, even after EQ'ing, works well for calls but didn't sound great with music or music-heavy movies. Second, Lenovo doesn't make an app for Android, iOS, macOS, or anything other than Windows. You must download Lenovo's Windows app to update their firmware, adjust settings, and EQ them. Third, their touch controls are limited. There\u2019s a glossy strip on the earbuds that seem like they\u2019d be great for volume controls, but they only have basic tap controls that are wonky. Fourth, Atmos sounds terrible. Like every other company that tries to upscale stereo audio to faux surround sound, the results are awful sounding, and I left Atmos off. Lastly, their ANC is on par with $40 earbuds from competing brands. It\u2019s nice that Lenovo offers ANC, but it isn\u2019t anything to write home about and it had issues with my space heater, something earbuds from other companies (even at $40) had no issues cancelling out.Despite these negatives, there are a few positives that make these a solid purchase for PC use. They maintain a solid connection to my Lenovo and Dell PCs. I could stay within a 10ft radius without experiencing dropouts or skips, even when in Teams meetings. I didn\u2019t have anyone complain about microphone quality or other issues. The microphone tech here was able to cancel out the space heater in my office along with other low office noises.Latency was low enough I could watch training videos and other videos without having lip sync delays. My Lenovo has Bluetooth 5.3, but my work-issued Dell system has Bluetooth 5.1 and latency was still low with it. Lenovo\u2019s app is easy to use once you get it installed, and it always connects to the earbuds without issues. The EQ was easy to adjust from a list of pre-sets or a simple band EQ you can adjust. Like I said, I could never get the bass levels I wanted or clarity in the highs, but having an EQ is better than not (I\u2019m looking at you, Apple).The case doesn\u2019t have Qi charging, I wish it would, but USB C charging was quick. These earbuds were getting me about 5 hours of use with ANC on, Lenovo advertises up 7 hours without ANC enabled. Much to my surprise, these earbuds feature wear detection. It\u2019s a simple light sensor, but it works. Take one earbud out while playing content and it will pause. You can use the earbuds independently as well.Overall, these aren\u2019t bad if you\u2019re looking for a pair of inexpensive earbuds to use for Teams meetings. They aren\u2019t great for music or movies, but they\u2019re still serviceable. These excel with calls and meetings while providing a solid connection to Windows PCs during Teams meetings, something other earbuds have issues with. I don\u2019t recommend these for media consumption, but they are great \u201cbusiness\u201d earbuds to get work done.",

        "review": "I got these because of my laptop and initially I thought they were good headphones/earbuds for like the first week but it has been a nightmare to use these. I can only get one or the other side to connect to blue tooth. I finally fixed that and got both sides to sync together and connect to Bluetooth and within less than a week it went back to me only been able to hear from one ear bud at a time. I am not connecting it to other devices!!!! It should not be so challenging to reset the earbuds and get them both synced up and they should not revert back to only one ear bud working at time. I wish I would have returned them during the time frame to get refund or replacement but snoozed off hoping to fix them. I am disappointed. I have spent too many hours trying to resolve this and when I did it went back to not functioning as intended within days.",

        "review": "I really wanted to like these earbuds.  They are a nice color, not the usual black.  The case is well made, though I would have liked a feel that was less slick, and a squared off base so it could set up on my desk.  They last about 4 hours listening to videos and audio books.  I am not one to use noise cancelling, I like to hear what is going on around me, but I did test it and there was a significant reduction in the noise in my office.  The instructions were a little lacking, there were pictures that told how to turn the earbuds and noise cancelling on/off.  I can supposedly register the earbuds, but do not see the serial number, and the only QR code on the box does not scan with my phone.  There was also mention of an app for further adjustments and updates to the earbuds, but after much searching I found it is an app for a computer, not cellphone.  This is very disappointing since I would be primarily using them at work and cannot download an app to my work computer.  After trying them out at work for 8 hours (you can use 1 bud at a time), I found them uncomfortable.  They fit very similarly to the newer apple buds, which I can't wear for the same reason.  The sound was ok.  With lower voices I didn't notice any issues, but the audio book I was listening to has a female narrator, and sounded a little tinny.  The app is supposed to allow you to make adjustments, but I cannot verify that.",
