Frustrating. I perceived no improvement on sound quality over my old $50 Anker Space A40s. Furthermore, Sony's setup app is malware: it hides among the legal agreements an \"Agree\" to data sharing.

All this said, you might nevertheless want to try these with your phone and cross your fingers that they can stay connected, because the noise cancelling and sound is that good.

        "review": "This is my 2nd pair of Sennheiser earbuds and I will never buy any other brand. My last pair lasted a few years and that was with me using them practically at full blast every single day at work from 8-5 so the price is well worth it imo.My favorite thing about this brand is how customizable they are in both the fit and sound.My ears are an odd shape so it's hard for me to find earbuds that fit while also not being bulky and feeling like they're going to constantly fall out. The different tip and wing sizes they give are perfect for finding the right fit for any ear shape so they're comfortable enough to leave in all day.On the app you can also customize the sound you want based on your own desires or music style you listen to as well which is perfect for me. The transparency mode on these is also amazing so I can leave them in all day and just pause my music when I want to talk to someone and not deal with taking them out. And the battery life these things have is amazing enough for me to do just that!10/10 recommend these!",

They also last quite a while before needed to be recharged. And the quality LOOKS great.That\u2019s about where the pros end, and the cons begin.First off they don\u2019t sound much better than AirPod Pros, and yet they\u2019re $50 more. Then comes the worst part - the reliability. I had these earbuds for roughly 2 months before they started having issues, specifically the right earbud. At first it would struggle connecting and wouldn\u2019t charge at random point even though the left one was doing just fine. Then, roughly around the month and a half mark, the right earbud stopped working completely. Would not charge, play music, or even connect. It was completely dead. At around the 2 month mark, the left earbud followed suit. So I sent in the earbuds to one of their warranty claim centers, and it has been a downward spiral ever since.I\u2019ve have dealt with customer support many times before, but this has to be the worst customer support I\u2019ve ever dealt with. Here\u2019s why:First off, finding their support number is not easy, as Sennheiser does not have a support center now that they are owned by Sonova. And to find their RMA website is even more difficult. Next, I never received any updates on the status\u2014not even an email confirming receipt. I called shortly after the earbuds were expected to be delivered to check if they even received it and was told that they did but the facility is \u201coffline\u201d meaning they will only email you once the package has been sent back to you. On top of that, they informed me that it would take roughly 2 weeks (10 business days all in all) to get everything dealt with. I said okay and moved on.That wasn\u2019t the end of it.Sennheiser finally emails me to ask me for proof of purchase, to which I quickly reply with a screenshot of the purchase details from Amazon. In the email it said that if I did not reply within 5 business days of the email, they would send back the earbuds. Now, 4 business days later, I receive an email saying that the receipt did not the proof of purchase details necessary, giving me less than a day to deal with this.Last thing to note, I did some research when I started seeing these issues and it appears that the malfunction I had with my earbuds has been around for a few years now, ever since their 2nd series of these earbuds. It\u2019s clear that the issue hasn\u2019t been fixed by Sennheiser since then.Overall, I would not recommend these by a long shot. I always heard everyone praise Sennheiser\u2019s headphones and earbuds so I thought it would be a smarter buy than AirPod Pros. Unfortunately I am now regretting that decision as the AirPod Pros would\u2019ve lasted me far longer and Apple support would have dealt with any issues much more efficiently than these people have.",

After firmware update and reset no change. Return started because of this.When both earbuds were in use, ANC was good with wind filtering, and decent transparency.If it would've worked with both buds, would've been better but I don't have the time to sit with it to troubleshoot.Attempted fixes to remedy.Reset Bluetooth on phoneReset buds, refreshed firmware, charged fully and let remain in case.Reran fitment test in app.Repaired to device.Nothing. No change still stopped on only one bud.",

Apple AirPods Pro 3 kept falling out, other buds just don't sound good, but these are the ones. Excellent German engineering.They have come a long way since the first generation of these (I got those too). Everything has had significant upgrade (noise cancelling, quality, bluetooth connectivity esp. multi-connection between iPhone and Mac, etc)",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better.

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

        "review": "These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

The different tip and wing sizes they give are perfect for finding the right fit for any ear shape so they're comfortable enough to leave in all day.On the app you can also customize the sound you want based on your own desires or music style you listen to as well which is perfect for me.

They also last quite a while before needed to be recharged. And the quality LOOKS great.That\u2019s about where the pros end, and the cons begin.First off they don\u2019t sound much better than AirPod Pros, and yet they\u2019re $50 more. Then comes the worst part - the reliability. I had these earbuds for roughly 2 months before they started having issues, specifically the right earbud. At first it would struggle connecting and wouldn\u2019t charge at random point even though the left one was doing just fine. Then, roughly around the month and a half mark, the right earbud stopped working completely. Would not charge, play music, or even connect. It was completely dead. At around the 2 month mark, the left earbud followed suit. So I sent in the earbuds to one of their warranty claim centers, and it has been a downward spiral ever since.I\u2019ve have dealt with customer support many times before, but this has to be the worst customer support I\u2019ve ever dealt with. Here\u2019s why:First off, finding their support number is not easy, as Sennheiser does not have a support center now that they are owned by Sonova. And to find their RMA website is even more difficult. Next, I never received any updates on the status\u2014not even an email confirming receipt. I called shortly after the earbuds were expected to be delivered to check if they even received it and was told that they did but the facility is \u201coffline\u201d meaning they will only email you once the package has been sent back to you. On top of that, they informed me that it would take roughly 2 weeks (10 business days all in all) to get everything dealt with. I said okay and moved on.That wasn\u2019t the end of it.Sennheiser finally emails me to ask me for proof of purchase, to which I quickly reply with a screenshot of the purchase details from Amazon. In the email it said that if I did not reply within 5 business days of the email, they would send back the earbuds. Now, 4 business days later, I receive an email saying that the receipt did not the proof of purchase details necessary, giving me less than a day to deal with this.Last thing to note, I did some research when I started seeing these issues and it appears that the malfunction I had with my earbuds has been around for a few years now, ever since their 2nd series of these earbuds. It\u2019s clear that the issue hasn\u2019t been fixed by Sennheiser since then.Overall, I would not recommend these by a long shot. I always heard everyone praise Sennheiser\u2019s headphones and earbuds so I thought it would be a smarter buy than AirPod Pros. Unfortunately I am now regretting that decision as the AirPod Pros would\u2019ve lasted me far longer and Apple support would have dealt with any issues much more efficiently than these people have.",

        "review": "TL:DR - Best sub-$200 earbuds with great noise canceling, superb sound and better than Samsung Galaxy Buds in every way.I recently had my Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus (purchased fall 2020) finally stop working (thank you, planned obsolescence). In researching for new buds, I began looking outside Samsung as I've always wanted to try the Sony buds, and the new Galaxy Buds Pro do not stay in my ears (I tried my sister's pair). Some YouTube reviews pitted the Sony buds against these, and I knew Senheiser to be a reputable audio brand so I decided to give them a shot. Also, the Sony's were almost 2 years old and hard to find, and the new version was over $200.First, noise canceling: I've never used a pair of noise canceling anything before, so take what I'm about to say with a few grains of salt. My test was to try it in my living room with a TV on normal listening volume, furnace running (mine is fairly noisy, enough to need to crank the TV up a few notches), and normal conversation happening in the kitchen about 15 feet away with no walls separating it. I couldn't hear the furnace at all, the conversation was like a whisper, and the TV was only slightly audible. It was like having it on level 3 or 4 above mute which would be completely inaudible with the furnace running. Now, it did not filter out any harsh or loud noises, like a dog barking or dishes clattering, but the passive isolation is good enough that it wasn't a big deal.Second, sound: Senheiser has a good reputation for a reason. I'm a basshead who routinely listens to hip hop, heavy metal and some electronic music. As a former music major in college and amateur DJ, I also love to fiddle around with equalizers to find the perfect sound for me. Straight out the box with no EQ enabled, the bass is pretty flat and that worried me. But the mids and highs were excellent and FAR better than the Samsungs I used to have. Once I fired up my EQ app (Poweramp EQ on Android), my worries were gone. I was able to tune it so that the bass was like having 2 10-inch subwoofers in my ears without drowning out the rest of the music. I listen to a lot of podcasts as well, and they are excellent for voice-only content as well.Call Quality: Every time I've had a phone call on these buds, no one has complained that I was inaudible in any way.Connection and Range: I can make it further and through more walls/obstructions than my old Galaxy Buds. They perform excellent, and only cut out after about 50 direct feet and 2 home floors comprised of wood, carpet and finally a brick wall on my back patio. The available APTx bluetooth codec makes latency nonexistent.Fit: I mentioned that the new Galaxy Buds didn't fit me, and that was due to me having a larger outer ear shape. The Buds Plus I had used a wing tip that held it in place, but the new ones do not have that. I used the standard medium-sized tips that were installed on the Senheiser buds, and due to their square shape and how deep they go into my ear canal, they fit like a glove. I can headbang to Orbit Culture until I'm dizzy and sweaty and they won't budge.Verdict: you won't find a better pair of buds sub-$200 IMO, and if you don't find the sound to your liking, give a 3rd party EQ app (like Poweramp) a try before returning them.",

        "review": "Loved the 'Black Friday' pricing on these, but love the fit, comfort, & sound quality even more!  I got the Special Edition version of these ear buds.Had been using Galaxy Pro buds that I bought along with my Galaxy phone.  They were decent, but uncomfortable for long periods, & sound quality was just not what I expected from an earbud that expensive & I wish I had realized it soon enough to return the Galaxy Pro buds :(These CX Plus buds on the other hand, are well worth the MSRP!So far only charged them once when I first got them & I have yet to run down the battery.  Longest I've used them continuously at one time so far is about 6.5 hours & usually it's just a couple hours here, a couple hours there.  Most of the time I have the volume pretty low, at about 25% - 30%.  But I do put them back in the case between uses.  I would estimate a total usage so far of about 20 - 22 hours.The only cons for me are:>  the \"Transparent Hearing mode\" which seems to amplify external sounds just a little bit too much.... if it were scaled back about 10% - 15% I think it might be perfect.> noise cancellation which seems to add background noise that is noticeable in between songs.>  tap controls can be tricky, sometimes when I try to skip to next song, it will instead pause & unpause, and occasionally just pause.EDIT Sept. 17, 2023:  Been using these a LOT lately, I'm hearing stuff in music that I've never heard before , songs I've listened to thousands of times on various systems.  Things like whispered words in the background of some songs, acoustic guitar fills in some songs, noise from guitar picks, short 1 or 2 second guitar overlays on the Right track of a Hendrix song, even potentially unwanted outside sounds captured during recordings, or maybe even those were there deliberately???  I cannot believe all the stuff I've missed in songs over the years, but glad I finally have speakers/headphones good enough that I can finally hear them.Battery life has proven to be phenomenal, possibly because I have no need to play these loudly to block out external sounds like my table saw & dust collector, or when I want to ignore the world around me.  Although I don't track it completely, it seems like battery life for me may surpass the 24 hour mark.  I have done a 5 day stretch without charging and without the ear buds dying,  2 days were 6-8 hours of listening, the rest were 2-4 hours, so I would guess somewhere between 20 & 26 hours.",

I know a lot of the times its because there are debris clogging up the earbud but i actually cleaned it up and the problem persisted. I am surprised and disapointed because sennheiser is usually a good company so there is a chance I just got a bad product. But the thing is, trying to get warrenty service seems to be a nightmare. I need to fill out a form and they request a bunch of info that i do not have such as shipping account number, invoice account number, and purchase order/reference. It states on the site that i must contact support fot the numbers if i do not have it, but there is no way to get in touch with any support reps. The customer service phone number leads to a dial tone and there is no live chat to be found anywhere on their website even though the support page mentions a live chat. Even searching \"sennheiser live chat\" on google leads to the support page with no live chat. Defintely one of the worst hardware experiences I've ever had so far. The product itself is fine other then it not working. The sound quality is above average and the ANC is decent. The case feels super cheap, the lid feels like it will snap off at any moment. No matter how good the product is, I cannot justify giving it more then 0 stars for something I paid $160 for and only lasting 6 months with low usage.",

Fit is okay, I'm not a huge fan but they fit fine and aren't overly uncomfortable. Sound quality is pretty solid, though hampered by the open design (most low frequencies are inaudible). Battery life has also not been an issue at all, I have not had an earbud die while listening yet, even over some pretty long car rides.However, there is one absolutely massive, glaring issue that made me return these and give the 1 star rating. They keep randomly stopping. Sitting still at work, playing drums or guitar, walking at a normal pace on the street, it doesn't matter. During my 30 minute walk to work this morning, they randomly stopped playing 6 times. I think that it's a mix of two issues, the \"removal detection\" that paused music if you take the headphones out seems poorly tuned, and I believe the way these sit in my ears places the stems in the tops of my facial hair, and they are randomly pausing due to detecting those touches.For the price of these, I would most certainly hope for a better product, especially since there are really only 1-2 design flaws for an otherwise solid product. With better configuration these might still be usable, but they aren't for me",

Tried them again the next day but the soreness just continued and didn't disappear with use. Paaaaaain.Very lightweight and impressively so, but with how light they were, I kept having the notion that they were going to fall out and a few times that I didn't adjust, they did fall out.

I can close it by tilting forward, there's 0 resistance.If a loose fit and loose lid is ok with you, these are excellent for their price.There's no app, connecting them was super simple, and the build quality is good.When they release a more polished version that fixes the obvious issues, I'll be happy to purchase it and hopefully give a better review as I have a medical reason to use headphones that don't have any silicon.",

If I want to listen to something at a low volume I can only get the volume low enough by using developer options so the Bluetooth volume is it's not linked to the internal volume of the earbuds. For this I have to disable absolute volume and restart my phone. This works and I get the control of the volume on the low end but lose it on the high end. The maximum volume is now lower. So if I want to listen at a higher volume, I have to change the setting again and restart my phone. I tried using an app that changed the number of steps the phone volume has to 100. So one step is 1%. I'd still like to be able to get it quieter then it's is at 1% without having to use developer options to turn on and off the absolute volume. I've never had this issue with any other headphone, earbud, wireless speaker, or car audio. I tried using the EQ in the app to accomplish the same thing and of course it had no effect. The issue is that the sliders for the EQ in their app are relative to other slider positions. So if all of the sliders are brought down to -6b it sounds the same as if they're all in the center. I was able to use Androids EQ to bring the volume down a little bit lower.",

But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I\u2019d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The \u201cQuick setup guide\u201d was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone.  Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I\u2019m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone\u2019s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds.  I can\u2019t comment on failed bub issues yet, it\u2019s too early, so we\u2019ll see.I didn\u2019t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.",

        "review": "I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn\u2019t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn\u2019t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I\u2019ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don\u2019t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth  however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only \u201cissue\u201d I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It\u2019s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I\u2019ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I\u2019ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it\u2019s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It\u2019s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it\u2019s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.",

        "review": "So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The \"Bass Boost\" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean.

In the car I usually connect my phone to the radio to listen to the music, so no reason to use while driving. The most expensive brand that I bought was the DR Dre powerbeats. Decent sound at a decent price and great for the gym because they have the hook and will not fall off when exercising. But almost immediately they started having issues with charging. So then I got the Jabra elite 75T. I still have them, no issues with charging, great Bluetooth connectivity, decent active noise cancellation and decent sound. Im happy with them and still work good for the price. I paid $179 in amazon. But I wanted more regarding the sound quality so I started looking at reviews on You Tube and found the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3. Great sound, decent ANC, decent battery and connectivity. I compared them to Sony, Bose and Jabra and decided on the Sennheiser. Well, here we go....-Sound is amazing, very happy with them- Battery is as expected, I imagine base on the size of the buds, and sound they are putting out.- Wind noise will affect this buds, even with the software that you install will not be able to adjust and get most of the wind noise out. The Jabras do a better job at that-Connectivity..... hahaha, In the gym I had issues when my phone was on the floor and I walked away for about 20 feet to get the wipes to wipe the chair and I had several machines in the way, pretty weird that I would loose connectivity, not cool-Then this really started to get on my nerves, while using the buds I started to get some weird noises, like some interference and after a few visits to YT, I found out the culprit, there is a very small membrane between the rubber attachment that goes into tour ear and the earbud. I have to remove them, clean them and very carefully reglue them in place. Problem solved for a few weeks.  Then the problem came back, I just remove them completely and the high pitch noise was gone-This is the nail in the coffin... I bought this in October 2022, in less that a year the left bud stop working, will not charge, cleaned the connections and nothing. Will not charge at all. Right bud continued working and charging normally. I used it for answering calls inside my car while driving in the military base I work. Its all hands free device inside the base. Unfortunately a few days ago it also stopped charging at all. Same problem as the left.So , my advice is do not buy, base on my experience and also others having the same issues on the internet.My Jabras are still going strong, not as good quality sound but they do the job.",

        "review": "So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The \"Bass Boost\" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean.

        "review": "Got these on black friday sale for $180, which was a complete steal. For that price, no-brainer instant buy. Even for the 'regular' sale price of $230-250, these are great. The app is good, adjustable EQ that you can save as presets, connects reliably, battery life is absurdly long, pretty comfortable, and the sound quality is great. Rich deep bass and detailed highs. I vastly prefer the sound to the WH-1000XM5, Bose QC35II, and like it slightly more than the AirPods Pro 3. The ANC is not amazing like AirPods Pro 3, but not bad either, better than I expected.Basically, if you want headphones with great sound quality that are wireless and have good enough ANC to give you the best listening experience in a low to moderate noise environment, these are a great pick. I'm rarely going to reach for my Sennheiser HD6XX now that I have these.",

        "review": "The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are great wireless headphones. I find them to be really easy to use and they sound great. At lower volumes, the sound is v-shaped. But if you bump up the volume a few clicks everything is pretty much even-sounding and not v-shaped. The bass is great, better than my HD600s. The mid-range is lush and full and the treble is just enough to not be harsh. I was using a desk-based system with a topping 7-series dac and amp and the Sennheiser HD600s for a while. The momentum 4 give me portability which is a plus when doing house chores. The touch panel on the right earcup doesn't work that well so I turned it off in the app. The app you need to do firmware updates and control the features is called \"Sennheiser Smart Control Plus\" and it's available for android and iOS. A nice feature is that the headphones turn off when removed from the head, saving battery life. They sound pretty astounding and in my opinion don't even need EQ although it's available in the phone app. They fit a little snug but comfort is top notch. The clamping pressure is not bad and I don't even need noise cancellation since the seal is so good. The price on amazon is great for these when they're roughly half off retail. If you're looking for the classic Sennheiser quality and need something portable the Momentum 4 are a must buy.",

I\u2019m in love with the color scheme that they\u2019ve chosen \ud83d\ude0d.  White and gray never looked so amazing.The touch controls are a nice feature too. I enjoy using them. It\u2019s not complicated not one bit in my personal opinion and experience.The sound quality is pretty good.I don\u2019t know how to intelligently break down frequencies so you\u2019ll have to find an expert who heard these babies to go into detail.I did check out some of my favorite Southern Rap songs to hear how that bass hit and I can say that I wasn\u2019t disappointed and the highs were jamming right too while listening to hi hats in TRAP MUSICBut I am a bit worried about the longevity of these very pricey beauties.The R, L, and headphone name that are locating inside of the ear cup will eventually wear off and that\u2019s the very least of what I worry about. I\u2019m also knowing that the ear cups themselves will wear out as well and start to rip and tear apart just like the other headphones that I\u2019ve spent over $100+ bucks on!

        "review": "The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are great wireless headphones. I find them to be really easy to use and they sound great. At lower volumes, the sound is v-shaped. But if you bump up the volume a few clicks everything is pretty much even-sounding and not v-shaped. The bass is great, better than my HD600s. The mid-range is lush and full and the treble is just enough to not be harsh. I was using a desk-based system with a topping 7-series dac and amp and the Sennheiser HD600s for a while. The momentum 4 give me portability which is a plus when doing house chores. The touch panel on the right earcup doesn't work that well so I turned it off in the app. The app you need to do firmware updates and control the features is called \"Sennheiser Smart Control Plus\" and it's available for android and iOS. A nice feature is that the headphones turn off when removed from the head, saving battery life. They sound pretty astounding and in my opinion don't even need EQ although it's available in the phone app. They fit a little snug but comfort is top notch. The clamping pressure is not bad and I don't even need noise cancellation since the seal is so good. The price on amazon is great for these when they're roughly half off retail. If you're looking for the classic Sennheiser quality and need something portable the Momentum 4 are a must buy.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

        "review": "First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I\u2019ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem \u2013 only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they\u2019re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I\u2019ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I\u2019ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to \u201cstay alive\u201d.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it\u2019s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",

        "review": "TL:DR - Best sub-$200 earbuds with great noise canceling, superb sound and better than Samsung Galaxy Buds in every way.I recently had my Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus (purchased fall 2020) finally stop working (thank you, planned obsolescence). In researching for new buds, I began looking outside Samsung as I've always wanted to try the Sony buds, and the new Galaxy Buds Pro do not stay in my ears (I tried my sister's pair). Some YouTube reviews pitted the Sony buds against these, and I knew Senheiser to be a reputable audio brand so I decided to give them a shot. Also, the Sony's were almost 2 years old and hard to find, and the new version was over $200.First, noise canceling: I've never used a pair of noise canceling anything before, so take what I'm about to say with a few grains of salt. My test was to try it in my living room with a TV on normal listening volume, furnace running (mine is fairly noisy, enough to need to crank the TV up a few notches), and normal conversation happening in the kitchen about 15 feet away with no walls separating it. I couldn't hear the furnace at all, the conversation was like a whisper, and the TV was only slightly audible. It was like having it on level 3 or 4 above mute which would be completely inaudible with the furnace running. Now, it did not filter out any harsh or loud noises, like a dog barking or dishes clattering, but the passive isolation is good enough that it wasn't a big deal.Second, sound: Senheiser has a good reputation for a reason. I'm a basshead who routinely listens to hip hop, heavy metal and some electronic music. As a former music major in college and amateur DJ, I also love to fiddle around with equalizers to find the perfect sound for me. Straight out the box with no EQ enabled, the bass is pretty flat and that worried me. But the mids and highs were excellent and FAR better than the Samsungs I used to have. Once I fired up my EQ app (Poweramp EQ on Android), my worries were gone. I was able to tune it so that the bass was like having 2 10-inch subwoofers in my ears without drowning out the rest of the music. I listen to a lot of podcasts as well, and they are excellent for voice-only content as well.Call Quality: Every time I've had a phone call on these buds, no one has complained that I was inaudible in any way.Connection and Range: I can make it further and through more walls/obstructions than my old Galaxy Buds. They perform excellent, and only cut out after about 50 direct feet and 2 home floors comprised of wood, carpet and finally a brick wall on my back patio. The available APTx bluetooth codec makes latency nonexistent.Fit: I mentioned that the new Galaxy Buds didn't fit me, and that was due to me having a larger outer ear shape. The Buds Plus I had used a wing tip that held it in place, but the new ones do not have that. I used the standard medium-sized tips that were installed on the Senheiser buds, and due to their square shape and how deep they go into my ear canal, they fit like a glove. I can headbang to Orbit Culture until I'm dizzy and sweaty and they won't budge.Verdict: you won't find a better pair of buds sub-$200 IMO, and if you don't find the sound to your liking, give a 3rd party EQ app (like Poweramp) a try before returning them.",

        "review": "Loved the 'Black Friday' pricing on these, but love the fit, comfort, & sound quality even more!  I got the Special Edition version of these ear buds.Had been using Galaxy Pro buds that I bought along with my Galaxy phone.  They were decent, but uncomfortable for long periods, & sound quality was just not what I expected from an earbud that expensive & I wish I had realized it soon enough to return the Galaxy Pro buds :(These CX Plus buds on the other hand, are well worth the MSRP!So far only charged them once when I first got them & I have yet to run down the battery.  Longest I've used them continuously at one time so far is about 6.5 hours & usually it's just a couple hours here, a couple hours there.  Most of the time I have the volume pretty low, at about 25% - 30%.  But I do put them back in the case between uses.  I would estimate a total usage so far of about 20 - 22 hours.The only cons for me are:>  the \"Transparent Hearing mode\" which seems to amplify external sounds just a little bit too much.... if it were scaled back about 10% - 15% I think it might be perfect.> noise cancellation which seems to add background noise that is noticeable in between songs.>  tap controls can be tricky, sometimes when I try to skip to next song, it will instead pause & unpause, and occasionally just pause.EDIT Sept. 17, 2023:  Been using these a LOT lately, I'm hearing stuff in music that I've never heard before , songs I've listened to thousands of times on various systems.  Things like whispered words in the background of some songs, acoustic guitar fills in some songs, noise from guitar picks, short 1 or 2 second guitar overlays on the Right track of a Hendrix song, even potentially unwanted outside sounds captured during recordings, or maybe even those were there deliberately???  I cannot believe all the stuff I've missed in songs over the years, but glad I finally have speakers/headphones good enough that I can finally hear them.Battery life has proven to be phenomenal, possibly because I have no need to play these loudly to block out external sounds like my table saw & dust collector, or when I want to ignore the world around me.  Although I don't track it completely, it seems like battery life for me may surpass the 24 hour mark.  I have done a 5 day stretch without charging and without the ear buds dying,  2 days were 6-8 hours of listening, the rest were 2-4 hours, so I would guess somewhere between 20 & 26 hours.",

I know a lot of the times its because there are debris clogging up the earbud but i actually cleaned it up and the problem persisted. I am surprised and disapointed because sennheiser is usually a good company so there is a chance I just got a bad product. But the thing is, trying to get warrenty service seems to be a nightmare. I need to fill out a form and they request a bunch of info that i do not have such as shipping account number, invoice account number, and purchase order/reference. It states on the site that i must contact support fot the numbers if i do not have it, but there is no way to get in touch with any support reps. The customer service phone number leads to a dial tone and there is no live chat to be found anywhere on their website even though the support page mentions a live chat. Even searching \"sennheiser live chat\" on google leads to the support page with no live chat. Defintely one of the worst hardware experiences I've ever had so far. The product itself is fine other then it not working. The sound quality is above average and the ANC is decent. The case feels super cheap, the lid feels like it will snap off at any moment. No matter how good the product is, I cannot justify giving it more then 0 stars for something I paid $160 for and only lasting 6 months with low usage.",

When tapping a bus twice (carefully, directly on the earbud), it might register zero taps, one tap, or two taps. Thus, your two taps will randomly do nothing, pause the music, or skip the track. Frustrating. I perceived no improvement on sound quality over my old $50 Anker Space A40s. Furthermore, Sony's setup app is malware: it hides among the legal agreements an \"Agree\" to data sharing. I don't know what Wirecutter is smoking; I liked nothing about these.Bose QuietComfort Ultra\ud83d\udfca\ud83d\udfca\ud83d\udfca\u2606\u2606I was so close to loving these. The noise cancelling is incredible. The \"Immersive Mode\" brings music to life in a way I hadn't experienced with earbuds. However, the deal killer was that the earbuds would disconnect from my phone every few minutes. This is apparently a common issue. Additionally, the tap controls are better than Sony's, but still bad: you're supposed to slide your finger along it to change the volume, but this often registers as a tap. All this said, you might nevertheless want to try these with your phone and cross your fingers that they can stay connected, because the noise cancelling and sound is that good. If they work for you, you've won the lottery, and you're a lucky bastard.

My last pair lasted a few years and that was with me using them practically at full blast every single day at work from 8-5 so the price is well worth it imo.My favorite thing about this brand is how customizable they are in both the fit and sound.My ears are an odd shape so it's hard for me to find earbuds that fit while also not being bulky and feeling like they're going to constantly fall out. The different tip and wing sizes they give are perfect for finding the right fit for any ear shape so they're comfortable enough to leave in all day.On the app you can also customize the sound you want based on your own desires or music style you listen to as well which is perfect for me. The transparency mode on these is also amazing so I can leave them in all day and just pause my music when I want to talk to someone and not deal with taking them out. And the battery life these things have is amazing enough for me to do just that!10/10 recommend these!",

        "review": "Let me start off with the pros.They sound great, and their app lets you personalize the audio however you wish. The fit is snug and the earbuds never fell out. They also last quite a while before needed to be recharged. And the quality LOOKS great.That\u2019s about where the pros end, and the cons begin.First off they don\u2019t sound much better than AirPod Pros, and yet they\u2019re $50 more. Then comes the worst part - the reliability. I had these earbuds for roughly 2 months before they started having issues, specifically the right earbud. At first it would struggle connecting and wouldn\u2019t charge at random point even though the left one was doing just fine. Then, roughly around the month and a half mark, the right earbud stopped working completely. Would not charge, play music, or even connect. It was completely dead. At around the 2 month mark, the left earbud followed suit. So I sent in the earbuds to one of their warranty claim centers, and it has been a downward spiral ever since.I\u2019ve have dealt with customer support many times before, but this has to be the worst customer support I\u2019ve ever dealt with. Here\u2019s why:First off, finding their support number is not easy, as Sennheiser does not have a support center now that they are owned by Sonova. And to find their RMA website is even more difficult. Next, I never received any updates on the status\u2014not even an email confirming receipt. I called shortly after the earbuds were expected to be delivered to check if they even received it and was told that they did but the facility is \u201coffline\u201d meaning they will only email you once the package has been sent back to you. On top of that, they informed me that it would take roughly 2 weeks (10 business days all in all) to get everything dealt with. I said okay and moved on.That wasn\u2019t the end of it.Sennheiser finally emails me to ask me for proof of purchase, to which I quickly reply with a screenshot of the purchase details from Amazon. In the email it said that if I did not reply within 5 business days of the email, they would send back the earbuds. Now, 4 business days later, I receive an email saying that the receipt did not the proof of purchase details necessary, giving me less than a day to deal with this.Last thing to note, I did some research when I started seeing these issues and it appears that the malfunction I had with my earbuds has been around for a few years now, ever since their 2nd series of these earbuds. It\u2019s clear that the issue hasn\u2019t been fixed by Sennheiser since then.Overall, I would not recommend these by a long shot. I always heard everyone praise Sennheiser\u2019s headphones and earbuds so I thought it would be a smarter buy than AirPod Pros. Unfortunately I am now regretting that decision as the AirPod Pros would\u2019ve lasted me far longer and Apple support would have dealt with any issues much more efficiently than these people have.",

        "review": "After the left side of my previous earbuds died, I needed a new pair and thought to go with Sennheiser since I have used their HD6XX at my PC for years now with no issues.Other than the one main issue mentioned in the title, these are solid. Fit is okay, I'm not a huge fan but they fit fine and aren't overly uncomfortable. Sound quality is pretty solid, though hampered by the open design (most low frequencies are inaudible). Battery life has also not been an issue at all, I have not had an earbud die while listening yet, even over some pretty long car rides.However, there is one absolutely massive, glaring issue that made me return these and give the 1 star rating. They keep randomly stopping. Sitting still at work, playing drums or guitar, walking at a normal pace on the street, it doesn't matter. During my 30 minute walk to work this morning, they randomly stopped playing 6 times. I think that it's a mix of two issues, the \"removal detection\" that paused music if you take the headphones out seems poorly tuned, and I believe the way these sit in my ears places the stems in the tops of my facial hair, and they are randomly pausing due to detecting those touches.For the price of these, I would most certainly hope for a better product, especially since there are really only 1-2 design flaws for an otherwise solid product. With better configuration these might still be usable, but they aren't for me",

Tried them again the next day but the soreness just continued and didn't disappear with use. Paaaaaain.Very lightweight and impressively so, but with how light they were, I kept having the notion that they were going to fall out and a few times that I didn't adjust, they did fall out. The falling out could be due to my ears just not being a good fit for these earbuds. They might work well for someone else, just not me.",

But it has a lot of deal breakers that come down to product design.First of all, it's not one size fits all. I have a fairly generic ear size, and any time i bend down slightly or even so much as look down, they begin to fall out.Second of all,  the case has an extremely loose lid. I can close it by tilting forward, there's 0 resistance.If a loose fit and loose lid is ok with you, these are excellent for their price.There's no app, connecting them was super simple, and the build quality is good.When they release a more polished version that fixes the obvious issues, I'll be happy to purchase it and hopefully give a better review as I have a medical reason to use headphones that don't have any silicon.",

        "review": "If you\u2019ve always had issues with sennheiser\u2019s fit on your ears with their smaller earbuds, this is the one for you.These are not for working out, for those momentum sport would be the equivalent.They sound almost perfect with the exception of not hitting the highest highs, and the majority of \u201ccomplaints\u201d are probably because they somehow made it so these won\u2019t hurt your hearing, so the gain is kept in check by its sound processing, which is a bonus honestly.They feature decent noise cancelling and some IPX protection for the buds only for light rain for your commute.Lastly, I think my favorite feature is multipoint connection so you don\u2019t have to manage what it\u2019s connected to though you still can manage that too through the app. They also have a wear sensor to pause if you take them out (can be disabled).The only issue for some might be that the touch controls have a very specific activation point which you\u2019ll either love or hate based on how much you have to take them off and how often (it makes it easier to take them off without activating them).Check the other specs to see if it meets your needs, I don\u2019t use buds to take calls (that\u2019s a terrible use case for any bud), and for that I\u2019d recommend something with a boom mic.",

It does not sound as good as the boom mic on a call center type Plantronics headset, but it\u2019s usable.  Bettery life is good. I can easily listen to a whole Purple Rain Soundtrack, then Ritual de lo Habitual, and a few hours of YouTubes, then accidentally let it run out by taking them out and not putting them away properly or if I do, there\u2019s still room for a little more Sneaker Pimps, UGK, or Nicolas Jaar before Damn!

        "review": "I got these after my 3rd set of Bose gave out after a year. It\u2019s sad that no matter how much I spend, or how little, ear buds seem to only last 1 single year. But I digress. I decided to try the Sennheiser ACCENTUM. They fit great, sounded great with a noice canceling capability that was even above the Bose. A win win! Then, a week later\u2026I began my day as usual and put in the earbuds. Something wasn\u2019t right. The right side wasn\u2019t working. Hmm ok I must\u2019ve seated it wrong to charge. I looked at the app and sure enough it seemed to be the case. Odd, but oh well. Then the next week, same thing except this time everything seemed ok but after wearing them for 5 minutes the built in voice told me to charge the headset. This has happened on an irregular basis but no less than 3-4 times a month. I had reached out to sennheiser, but to no avail. Customer service must not be a priority with them. I haven\u2019t bothered simply returning them because I have an extra headset I can use while I reseat the buds and charge them for an hour. Call me lazy - I would.The other shortcoming I have to list is the shorter battery life, at least compared to the Bose quietcomfort. It doesn\u2019t even last a full six hours. The Bose lasted over 8.In the long run, I wear them for the noise canceling. The sound is good but I only listen to podcasts and audiobooks so there\u2019s that.The app is ok and does have a lot more features than the Bose does. But that\u2019s not really a selling point for me.In conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t really recommend these until the charging issues are fixed. From what I\u2019ve read in a few places, I certainly am not alone in having this issue.Why can\u2019t there be a company that can produce something worthwhile. It\u2019s not like the big names don\u2019t have the experience. They just all want to make things substandard and over hype them. As if we are made of money. *sigh*",

        "review": "TLDR: My least favorite Sennheiser earbuds.I've been using Sennheiser earbuds for at least eight years now, and I've tried their full line by now. I'm not an audiophile, I'm only listening to audiobooks and taking calls, so please take my suggestions about audio quality with a grain of salt.I usually buy two of whatever earbuds at a time, and they get swapped when one runs out of battery, so technically this review is for a pair of these.1. Audio quality. Accentum seems fine, but IMO the CX series sounds better.  Mic quality seems good, but I've never had problems there with anything Sennheiser.2. The ANC and passthrough are absolutely terrible on Accentum. To the point where I can't easily tell if it's even on. It's not a feature I absolutely need, but do not count ANC as a major benefit on Accentum.3. Totally unscientific, but the battery life seems bad on Accentum compared to CX. It's possible this is because I have ANC on and don't notice it, but the practical effect is I hear \"battery low\" more times a day.4. The case is just asinine. It's lovely that it charges wireless, but why would you put the usb plug facing the same direction the thing opens? Also, it's not deep enough to reliably fit foam eartips -- the foam tends to push them up just enough over time that it triggers a new \"connecting device\".5. I got 3 months usage with one set before one of the buds cut out. idk what the warranty situation is, but I have some CX survivors that are over 2 years old. Yes, they're tiny delicate devices that I wear like 16 hours a day, but 3 months is too short.The only plus I'll give Accentum over CX is that it is nice having a slimmer profile on the earbuds. Personally I'd take better battery life over a slimmer profile, but that's up to you.After a short stint with Accentum, I'm switching back to CX.",

I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The \"Bass Boost\" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean. You can eq the treble back in, but someone like Sennheiser should have a better solution than that with their software.The bluetooth range is not great with my Samsung S21 Ultra. With my old Jaybird Tarah pro's which are several years old, I could leave my phone in the garage and walk to the back yard and stay connected. with these I barely get to the end of driveway b4 they start cutting out (maybe 30ish feet or so). Not a big deal for me since I'm almost always near the phone when working, but if you are routinely farther away, might be something to consider.All in all they have been a great upgrade for me and I'm definitely hanging on to them.",

        "review": "So I waffled between the big 3 (sony, bose and these) b4 pulling the trigger on these since they went on sale. I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The \"Bass Boost\" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean. You can eq the treble back in, but someone like Sennheiser should have a better solution than that with their software.The bluetooth range is not great with my Samsung S21 Ultra. With my old Jaybird Tarah pro's which are several years old, I could leave my phone in the garage and walk to the back yard and stay connected. with these I barely get to the end of driveway b4 they start cutting out (maybe 30ish feet or so). Not a big deal for me since I'm almost always near the phone when working, but if you are routinely farther away, might be something to consider.All in all they have been a great upgrade for me and I'm definitely hanging on to them.",

        "review": "I never do reviews of products, but in this case I will because of the price of this product. In the past I bought  cheap earbuds. Mostly because I use them for the gym. In the car I usually connect my phone to the radio to listen to the music, so no reason to use while driving. The most expensive brand that I bought was the DR Dre powerbeats. Decent sound at a decent price and great for the gym because they have the hook and will not fall off when exercising. But almost immediately they started having issues with charging. So then I got the Jabra elite 75T. I still have them, no issues with charging, great Bluetooth connectivity, decent active noise cancellation and decent sound. Im happy with them and still work good for the price. I paid $179 in amazon. But I wanted more regarding the sound quality so I started looking at reviews on You Tube and found the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3. Great sound, decent ANC, decent battery and connectivity. I compared them to Sony, Bose and Jabra and decided on the Sennheiser. Well, here we go....-Sound is amazing, very happy with them- Battery is as expected, I imagine base on the size of the buds, and sound they are putting out.- Wind noise will affect this buds, even with the software that you install will not be able to adjust and get most of the wind noise out. The Jabras do a better job at that-Connectivity..... hahaha, In the gym I had issues when my phone was on the floor and I walked away for about 20 feet to get the wipes to wipe the chair and I had several machines in the way, pretty weird that I would loose connectivity, not cool-Then this really started to get on my nerves, while using the buds I started to get some weird noises, like some interference and after a few visits to YT, I found out the culprit, there is a very small membrane between the rubber attachment that goes into tour ear and the earbud. I have to remove them, clean them and very carefully reglue them in place. Problem solved for a few weeks.  Then the problem came back, I just remove them completely and the high pitch noise was gone-This is the nail in the coffin... I bought this in October 2022, in less that a year the left bud stop working, will not charge, cleaned the connections and nothing. Will not charge at all. Right bud continued working and charging normally. I used it for answering calls inside my car while driving in the military base I work. Its all hands free device inside the base. Unfortunately a few days ago it also stopped charging at all. Same problem as the left.So , my advice is do not buy, base on my experience and also others having the same issues on the internet.My Jabras are still going strong, not as good quality sound but they do the job.",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I\u2019d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The \u201cQuick setup guide\u201d was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone.  Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I\u2019m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone\u2019s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds.  I can\u2019t comment on failed bub issues yet, it\u2019s too early, so we\u2019ll see.I didn\u2019t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.",

        "review": "I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn\u2019t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn\u2019t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I\u2019ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don\u2019t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth  however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only \u201cissue\u201d I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It\u2019s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I\u2019ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I\u2019ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it\u2019s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It\u2019s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it\u2019s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus.

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either.

        "review": "Got these on black friday sale for $180, which was a complete steal. For that price, no-brainer instant buy. Even for the 'regular' sale price of $230-250, these are great. The app is good, adjustable EQ that you can save as presets, connects reliably, battery life is absurdly long, pretty comfortable, and the sound quality is great. Rich deep bass and detailed highs. I vastly prefer the sound to the WH-1000XM5, Bose QC35II, and like it slightly more than the AirPods Pro 3. The ANC is not amazing like AirPods Pro 3, but not bad either, better than I expected.Basically, if you want headphones with great sound quality that are wireless and have good enough ANC to give you the best listening experience in a low to moderate noise environment, these are a great pick. I'm rarely going to reach for my Sennheiser HD6XX now that I have these.",

        "review": "The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are great wireless headphones. I find them to be really easy to use and they sound great. At lower volumes, the sound is v-shaped. But if you bump up the volume a few clicks everything is pretty much even-sounding and not v-shaped. The bass is great, better than my HD600s. The mid-range is lush and full and the treble is just enough to not be harsh. I was using a desk-based system with a topping 7-series dac and amp and the Sennheiser HD600s for a while. The momentum 4 give me portability which is a plus when doing house chores. The touch panel on the right earcup doesn't work that well so I turned it off in the app. The app you need to do firmware updates and control the features is called \"Sennheiser Smart Control Plus\" and it's available for android and iOS. A nice feature is that the headphones turn off when removed from the head, saving battery life. They sound pretty astounding and in my opinion don't even need EQ although it's available in the phone app. They fit a little snug but comfort is top notch. The clamping pressure is not bad and I don't even need noise cancellation since the seal is so good. The price on amazon is great for these when they're roughly half off retail. If you're looking for the classic Sennheiser quality and need something portable the Momentum 4 are a must buy.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

        "review": "These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

        "review": "First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I\u2019ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem \u2013 only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they\u2019re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I\u2019ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I\u2019ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to \u201cstay alive\u201d.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it\u2019s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",

        "review": "TL:DR - Best sub-$200 earbuds with great noise canceling, superb sound and better than Samsung Galaxy Buds in every way.I recently had my Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus (purchased fall 2020) finally stop working (thank you, planned obsolescence). In researching for new buds, I began looking outside Samsung as I've always wanted to try the Sony buds, and the new Galaxy Buds Pro do not stay in my ears (I tried my sister's pair). Some YouTube reviews pitted the Sony buds against these, and I knew Senheiser to be a reputable audio brand so I decided to give them a shot. Also, the Sony's were almost 2 years old and hard to find, and the new version was over $200.First, noise canceling: I've never used a pair of noise canceling anything before, so take what I'm about to say with a few grains of salt. My test was to try it in my living room with a TV on normal listening volume, furnace running (mine is fairly noisy, enough to need to crank the TV up a few notches), and normal conversation happening in the kitchen about 15 feet away with no walls separating it. I couldn't hear the furnace at all, the conversation was like a whisper, and the TV was only slightly audible. It was like having it on level 3 or 4 above mute which would be completely inaudible with the furnace running. Now, it did not filter out any harsh or loud noises, like a dog barking or dishes clattering, but the passive isolation is good enough that it wasn't a big deal.Second, sound: Senheiser has a good reputation for a reason. I'm a basshead who routinely listens to hip hop, heavy metal and some electronic music. As a former music major in college and amateur DJ, I also love to fiddle around with equalizers to find the perfect sound for me. Straight out the box with no EQ enabled, the bass is pretty flat and that worried me. But the mids and highs were excellent and FAR better than the Samsungs I used to have. Once I fired up my EQ app (Poweramp EQ on Android), my worries were gone. I was able to tune it so that the bass was like having 2 10-inch subwoofers in my ears without drowning out the rest of the music. I listen to a lot of podcasts as well, and they are excellent for voice-only content as well.Call Quality: Every time I've had a phone call on these buds, no one has complained that I was inaudible in any way.Connection and Range: I can make it further and through more walls/obstructions than my old Galaxy Buds. They perform excellent, and only cut out after about 50 direct feet and 2 home floors comprised of wood, carpet and finally a brick wall on my back patio. The available APTx bluetooth codec makes latency nonexistent.Fit: I mentioned that the new Galaxy Buds didn't fit me, and that was due to me having a larger outer ear shape. The Buds Plus I had used a wing tip that held it in place, but the new ones do not have that. I used the standard medium-sized tips that were installed on the Senheiser buds, and due to their square shape and how deep they go into my ear canal, they fit like a glove. I can headbang to Orbit Culture until I'm dizzy and sweaty and they won't budge.Verdict: you won't find a better pair of buds sub-$200 IMO, and if you don't find the sound to your liking, give a 3rd party EQ app (like Poweramp) a try before returning them.",

        "review": "Loved the 'Black Friday' pricing on these, but love the fit, comfort, & sound quality even more!  I got the Special Edition version of these ear buds.Had been using Galaxy Pro buds that I bought along with my Galaxy phone.  They were decent, but uncomfortable for long periods, & sound quality was just not what I expected from an earbud that expensive & I wish I had realized it soon enough to return the Galaxy Pro buds :(These CX Plus buds on the other hand, are well worth the MSRP!So far only charged them once when I first got them & I have yet to run down the battery.  Longest I've used them continuously at one time so far is about 6.5 hours & usually it's just a couple hours here, a couple hours there.  Most of the time I have the volume pretty low, at about 25% - 30%.  But I do put them back in the case between uses.  I would estimate a total usage so far of about 20 - 22 hours.The only cons for me are:>  the \"Transparent Hearing mode\" which seems to amplify external sounds just a little bit too much.... if it were scaled back about 10% - 15% I think it might be perfect.> noise cancellation which seems to add background noise that is noticeable in between songs.>  tap controls can be tricky, sometimes when I try to skip to next song, it will instead pause & unpause, and occasionally just pause.EDIT Sept. 17, 2023:  Been using these a LOT lately, I'm hearing stuff in music that I've never heard before , songs I've listened to thousands of times on various systems.  Things like whispered words in the background of some songs, acoustic guitar fills in some songs, noise from guitar picks, short 1 or 2 second guitar overlays on the Right track of a Hendrix song, even potentially unwanted outside sounds captured during recordings, or maybe even those were there deliberately???  I cannot believe all the stuff I've missed in songs over the years, but glad I finally have speakers/headphones good enough that I can finally hear them.Battery life has proven to be phenomenal, possibly because I have no need to play these loudly to block out external sounds like my table saw & dust collector, or when I want to ignore the world around me.  Although I don't track it completely, it seems like battery life for me may surpass the 24 hour mark.  I have done a 5 day stretch without charging and without the ear buds dying,  2 days were 6-8 hours of listening, the rest were 2-4 hours, so I would guess somewhere between 20 & 26 hours.",

I know a lot of the times its because there are debris clogging up the earbud but i actually cleaned it up and the problem persisted. I am surprised and disapointed because sennheiser is usually a good company so there is a chance I just got a bad product. But the thing is, trying to get warrenty service seems to be a nightmare. I need to fill out a form and they request a bunch of info that i do not have such as shipping account number, invoice account number, and purchase order/reference. It states on the site that i must contact support fot the numbers if i do not have it, but there is no way to get in touch with any support reps. The customer service phone number leads to a dial tone and there is no live chat to be found anywhere on their website even though the support page mentions a live chat. Even searching \"sennheiser live chat\" on google leads to the support page with no live chat. Defintely one of the worst hardware experiences I've ever had so far. The product itself is fine other then it not working. The sound quality is above average and the ANC is decent. The case feels super cheap, the lid feels like it will snap off at any moment. No matter how good the product is, I cannot justify giving it more then 0 stars for something I paid $160 for and only lasting 6 months with low usage.",

        "review": "I got these after my 3rd set of Bose gave out after a year. It\u2019s sad that no matter how much I spend, or how little, ear buds seem to only last 1 single year. But I digress. I decided to try the Sennheiser ACCENTUM. They fit great, sounded great with a noice canceling capability that was even above the Bose. A win win! Then, a week later\u2026I began my day as usual and put in the earbuds. Something wasn\u2019t right. The right side wasn\u2019t working. Hmm ok I must\u2019ve seated it wrong to charge. I looked at the app and sure enough it seemed to be the case. Odd, but oh well. Then the next week, same thing except this time everything seemed ok but after wearing them for 5 minutes the built in voice told me to charge the headset. This has happened on an irregular basis but no less than 3-4 times a month. I had reached out to sennheiser, but to no avail. Customer service must not be a priority with them. I haven\u2019t bothered simply returning them because I have an extra headset I can use while I reseat the buds and charge them for an hour. Call me lazy - I would.The other shortcoming I have to list is the shorter battery life, at least compared to the Bose quietcomfort. It doesn\u2019t even last a full six hours. The Bose lasted over 8.In the long run, I wear them for the noise canceling. The sound is good but I only listen to podcasts and audiobooks so there\u2019s that.The app is ok and does have a lot more features than the Bose does. But that\u2019s not really a selling point for me.In conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t really recommend these until the charging issues are fixed. From what I\u2019ve read in a few places, I certainly am not alone in having this issue.Why can\u2019t there be a company that can produce something worthwhile. It\u2019s not like the big names don\u2019t have the experience. They just all want to make things substandard and over hype them. As if we are made of money. *sigh*",

        "review": "TLDR: My least favorite Sennheiser earbuds.I've been using Sennheiser earbuds for at least eight years now, and I've tried their full line by now. I'm not an audiophile, I'm only listening to audiobooks and taking calls, so please take my suggestions about audio quality with a grain of salt.I usually buy two of whatever earbuds at a time, and they get swapped when one runs out of battery, so technically this review is for a pair of these.1. Audio quality. Accentum seems fine, but IMO the CX series sounds better.  Mic quality seems good, but I've never had problems there with anything Sennheiser.2. The ANC and passthrough are absolutely terrible on Accentum. To the point where I can't easily tell if it's even on. It's not a feature I absolutely need, but do not count ANC as a major benefit on Accentum.3. Totally unscientific, but the battery life seems bad on Accentum compared to CX. It's possible this is because I have ANC on and don't notice it, but the practical effect is I hear \"battery low\" more times a day.4. The case is just asinine. It's lovely that it charges wireless, but why would you put the usb plug facing the same direction the thing opens? Also, it's not deep enough to reliably fit foam eartips -- the foam tends to push them up just enough over time that it triggers a new \"connecting device\".5. I got 3 months usage with one set before one of the buds cut out. idk what the warranty situation is, but I have some CX survivors that are over 2 years old. Yes, they're tiny delicate devices that I wear like 16 hours a day, but 3 months is too short.The only plus I'll give Accentum over CX is that it is nice having a slimmer profile on the earbuds. Personally I'd take better battery life over a slimmer profile, but that's up to you.After a short stint with Accentum, I'm switching back to CX.",

If I want to listen to something at a low volume I can only get the volume low enough by using developer options so the Bluetooth volume is it's not linked to the internal volume of the earbuds. For this I have to disable absolute volume and restart my phone. This works and I get the control of the volume on the low end but lose it on the high end. The maximum volume is now lower. So if I want to listen at a higher volume, I have to change the setting again and restart my phone. I tried using an app that changed the number of steps the phone volume has to 100. So one step is 1%. I'd still like to be able to get it quieter then it's is at 1% without having to use developer options to turn on and off the absolute volume. I've never had this issue with any other headphone, earbud, wireless speaker, or car audio. I tried using the EQ in the app to accomplish the same thing and of course it had no effect. The issue is that the sliders for the EQ in their app are relative to other slider positions. So if all of the sliders are brought down to -6b it sounds the same as if they're all in the center.

I feel like a lot of these reviews don't understand the basics of using ear hooks, or the necessity of using the app to flip between the two sound modes depending on the open ear tips or closed ear tips.If you're going to use the open ear tips (which have a couple tiny holes to let in some outside sound - not much, but enough that you can have a conversation without removing them), the Sennheiser app adjusts the base profile to make everything sound great. Same with using the closed tips.  I tried using the \"wrong\" settings on purpose to see the difference and wow, it changes the sound signature quite a bit to account for the open/closed earspace.  And they nailed it in keeping it sounding consistent depending on which ears tips you're using.PS - You also need to do the firmware update in the app.  Some nitpicks have long been addressed, it seems.Anyhow, I FINALLY found my workout pair.  It's been years of searching.  Definitely better sound than my Beats Fit Pro (very solid performer and almost perfect, but not great enough to justify the extra $100) or Earfun air pro 2s (which sounded awesome and are a great value, but I had to put an aftermarket silicone ear wing attachment on them every time i used them to keep them in, but which wouldnt fit back in the charging case if the tip was still attached).  These Sennheisers sound better than those two.  These sound comparable to the Jabra Elite 85T and might actually have more crisp bass response.  Loving the very robust battery life for a TW style earbud.  No issues at all so far.",

        "review": "I have only used the earbuds about a dozen or so times.  Mostly for jogging which is 15-20 minutes.  A couple of times for bicycling around for a few hours.THE GOODThey have an IP rating for water resistance.  Great for working out and resisting a few rain drops.  The sound quality is pretty good, especially the bass.  They are comfortable in the ear for a somewhat extended period of time, but not all day.  Eventually my ear gets tired and hurts from them.  So under 2 hours of use is ideal.  Your mileage may vary.THE MEDIOCREThese are not extremely loud when using outside in a busy street, such as walking, jogging, bicycling, or any outdoor activity with heavy vehicle traffic around.  I'm sure they are perfect for hiking, skiing/snowboarding, mountain biking, or the like, where there is some quiet.THE BADAfter a few uses, the left earbud has begun lowering the volume by itself after a few minutes of use, becoming inaudible, making only the right earbud produce proper sound level based on the volume level of the connected device.  I can barely hear the left earbud.  I have to go through the ritual of disabling all Bluetooth devices, manually restoring the earbuds to factory settings, re-paring them with each other, using the Sennheiser app to also perform a factory reset, putting them into the charging case to turn off, take them out of the charging case, reconnect them to device, sacrificing various animals and praying to some undead god beyond the cosmos, just get both earbuds working properly.  And it only lasts for a few minutes, maybe 10-15, before it does it again.  This is garbage.MY RECOMMENDATIONIf you have some money that wants to be liberated from your possession, buy these earbuds, use them a few times, and cherish each of those times it works.  Then subsequently smash them with a hammer, because they will be more useful as broken pieces of plastic and electronic innards, then keeping it around, frustrating you to no end as to why the damn earbuds don't work properly.",

        "review": "I have a Samsung S21 phone and wanted to get new wireless earbuds to replace my old wired ear phones.  I purchased and tried three other brands and I sent them all back due to either poor sound quality (not enough bass) or horrible battery life.  I was nearly ready to give up, when I tried these.  They sound FANTASTIC (I am a bit of an audiophile and sound quality is very important to me).  These earbuds have the very best sound I have found for any earbuds.  The fit in my ear is fantastic.  The software and pairing process is super easy.  My only criticism is occasionally one of the earbuds will lose it's Bluetooth connection - it only happens occasionally, but it is annoying.  It's easily fixed by touching the earbud once or twice to turn them on and off - the connection is then reestablished.  Overall, I love them.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point.

It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",
