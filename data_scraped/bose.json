        "review": "I've used many, many different pairs of earbuds. Most with active noise cancellation, and I can honestly say these are the best by a mile! I used them in a variaty of enviroments from a noisy office space, on a plan, and at home with the constant noise of my kids and their toys. Every time you put them in your ears, you're presented with a symponic sound that tunes the earbuds and checks the seal to your ear. It helps make the noise canceling feature work the best I've ever heard! I have a white noise machine that helps my wife sleep at night, and these buds can block out that sound 100% on its loudest setting! That way, when she's trying to sleep, I can watch some streaming content without the sound of anything in the background, making it easy to hear the smallest sound in what you're watching, like someone breathing in a quiet, tense moment, even when there's a bunch of noise all around you. The Bose app is great too! it makes it easy to customize the use of the earbuds, manage the devices they are connected to, and adjust the EQ and noise cancellation feature. The spartial audio feature makes it seem like you are listening in a large concert hall vs. a set of earbuds. You must try it when you get your pair! You can find it in the \"immersion\" menu in the Bose app on your phone. The earbuds fit very securely in your ear. There are enough fit pieces in the box to fit almost any ear shape. I love that the V2 has so many colors to choose from. I went with the black/gold version, and I love the way they look! overall, I give these a 5/5! well worh the money!",

        "review": "I have an Android phone and I was using a different earbuds which unfortunately Im unable to use all the features it touted. So I needed an earbuds that aside from comfort I'm able to use all capabilities. I've had other Bose products and I was fairly confident that Bose wouldn't let me down. I'm happy to say that yay, I got my money's worth! The sound quality was impressive and the sample audio clip that Bose had during the setup phase really showed that off. I like that it had all these different features in there, Still Immersion, etc. So of course, I listed to my own songs and it was great. Noise cancelling was superb in my honest opinion. I heard the difference when it is on and off. I didn't hear my Mom when she was talking with the earbuds on and I'm like duh! i have the earbuds on lol. This was without any sound on so my Mom's voice was so distant and far away. I also tested the Bose with my work laptop as I conduct video meetings and again I'm very happy with it. My coworkers did not complain that they couldn't hear me so it looks like the mic placement in the Bose is great. I'm happy to no longer use my big headphones with the sticking out microphone. By the way, the Bose was Bluetooth connected to my two devices, my Android Phone and work laptop and there was no issue to start using the work laptop for the video meetings so that was very convenient. In regard to fit, I did not change the pads. It looks like medium is my size, and so far, I have not experienced any pain in my ear from wearing it too long. I've had it on for about an hour. I will have to continue to observe if I experience any pain if I wear it for more than an hour. The case itself is pretty portable, in my opinion, and it is not slippery \u2014 which I love because I don\u2019t feel the need to purchase a case cover. This uses a USB-C and has wireless charging, and both so far have worked flawlessly. In conclusion, I totally recommend these Bose earbuds. I am using it for both work and personal reasons and so Im definitely getting the bang out of my buck.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds.

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds.

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",

        "review": "I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)I went with these two because1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.Let's start with jlabI'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..Bose.Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???How do they sound so much better?!I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale. I would like to have them in my collection for when I just need some good headbanging. Both headphones are great, but get the one you need for the life you live. Take care!",

        "review": "I rarely write reviews, due to lack of time and the fact that if a product performs the way it's supposed to, it doesn't deserve my time to review it. For the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, I will make an exception.Simply put, they are wonderful - the sound, the noise cancelling, the ease of fit and comfort.  A solid product all around.  I have never been a big Bose fan.  I thought their products were good, but not great and overpriced.  I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace my old faithful Jabra 65T Elites that finally died. They were nearly 4 years old and didn't owe me anything.  Based on reviews, I tried the Apple AirPod Pro 2nd gen, the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose.I was interested in the AirPods mostly because of their compatibility with my Iphone and my son's recommendation. I returned them for three reasons.  First, to get them to fit with a tight seal was an ordeal.  Fifteen minutes of futzing around to finally pass the seal test (and that's with Comply foam tips -- the Apple silicone tips didn't work for me period.) And even after passing the seal test, I did not find the ANC particularly effective.  Adjusting the volume by sliding my finger up and down the stem was wonky -- not working, pausing the music or shifting the bud, the seal I worked so hard to get, broke. Also, not having a real equalizer is a drawback. Apple has a customization wizard, but I like to have different settings for different genres of music.  The customization wizard uses Apple's own sound track.On to the Sony's.  I liked the Sony's.  I have the WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones for serious listening and they are great.  But they are not suitable to wear for dog walking, bike rides or the gym.  I need earbuds.  The over the ears are also bulky to take on airplane flights taking up a lot real estate in my string pack or messenger bag. Anyway, I tried the 1000XM5's and liked them.  The sound is very good as is the ANC.  The three drawbacks are ease of fit, comfort and volume control.  While easier to pass the seal fit test than the apples, it still took more futzing around than I care to do. Also, to pass the seal test, I had to use the large tips which hurt my ears after an hour.  Finally, the four tap volume control is a pain.  I either got know response or went back a track because I only tapped three times.So on to the Bose. Nirvana.Fit and Comfort.  So easy to get a fit with their innovative tip and wing combo.  The wings are really a small silicone gasket that fit inside your ear, but outside the ear canal. Select the right combo of tip and wing (sized independently) put them in your ear and you pass the fit test, first time, every time.  I hardly feel them in my ears.Sound Quality.  Superb. The Bose bathe me with aural warmth.  I liked the Sony sound until I listened to the Bose.  I would characterize the sound as warm but accurate.  The Sony sound is like sunlight.  The Bose sound is like an incandescent lamp.  Despite the warmth, the sound is always clean and bright when it needs to be.  I listen to a very wide range of music and the sound has been great for every genre. I think that classical music really tests the quality of an audio product due to the tonal range of instruments and voices and the variety of textures.  Listening to Mozart's Requiem was sublime. It was like falling in love all over again.  The immersion sound option raises the sound quality to a whole new level, bringing a depth and presence to the music. Just wow. And unlike the spatial music technology of Sony and Apple, immersion works for all sources. What I said about Mozart applies to any rock, jazz, and Latin that I have thrown out them. I've heard sounds, I've never heard before. The Bose app has a basic equalizer but I leave everything flat.ANC:  Can't be beat.  I can listen to quiet music while my wife is watching TV and it doesn't bother me.  Sharp sounds such as a firecracker breakthrough but it's not a sensory deprivation chamber after all.  I remember the early days of ANC -- it deadened the sound.  Not these buds.  The sound is alive and well.  Can't wait to take them on my first flight in two weeks.  And the aware mode is terrific.  Just switch to aware and have a conversation without taking the buds out or when using them while on a bike ride.Controls:  Work really well and sliding you finger to increase/decrease volume is easy, unlike my experience with the AirPod Pros.  I learned that the double and triple taps to move forwards and backwards between tracks does not have to be super rapid. Overall, the touch controls work as well as the physical controls of my old Jabra's.Phone calls: Very secondary for me but so far they have worked just fine.  I hear voices clearly and it seems that I am easily understood.Battery Life -- The only weakness- 4 hours with immersion on but I'm told with moderate volume, you can eke out 5 hours, enough for a cross country flight. And I will keep my over the ear Sony's up top in my carry on if I need them.  I am not too concerned.  Not concerned enough to take take a star off.Everybody's tastes are different.  Some folks will be wed to Apple and it's ecosystem and the buds are $50 less.  Sony has better battery life.  But for me, Bose wins hands down for the combination of fit, comfort, sound quality, ANC and controls.",

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.

Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.

The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.  Would be nice to maybe have better water and/or dust resistance...",

In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.  The best low cost alternative I tried are the Soundpeats pearl clips - great value for the money.  For call quality, it wasn't a huge priority for me.  The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.  Would be nice to maybe have better water and/or dust resistance...",

The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.  The best low cost alternative I tried are the Soundpeats pearl clips - great value for the money.  For call quality, it wasn't a huge priority for me.  The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.

In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.

The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.  Would be nice to maybe have better water and/or dust resistance...",

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

        "review": "i've bought and tried so many of these types of open style earbuds.  the anker c40s, shokz openfit 2, powerbeats pro 2 (not open but similar style), edifier lolliclip, soundpeats pealclip pro, and the list goes on.  I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.

It cuts out so much noise that when I take the buds out my ears, my brain has to adjust back to all the back ground noise again.Stability connections. Connecting Bluetooth when I first got the buds was easy but now is a whole new story. I have had one bud drop out of connection and the reconnect 3-5 minutes later. I have even had it were the buds was not insync with the sound.Comfort. I will say for myself I can wear the buds for a long period of time. The hardest part for me now is getting that tone in my ear to let me know it's a good fit in my ear. I have slept several times with them in my ears.App. This is where I think my biggest problem is with these buds. The app has a hand full of options and nothing impressive.

In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "As a previous owner the Baseus MC1 Pro, I already had high expectations for the XC1.The MC1 Pro sounded great and was very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good.

        "review": "First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don\u2019t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort\u2019s buttons to the Ultra\u2019s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45\u2019s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5\u2019s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm\u2019s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5\u2019s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they\u2019re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45\u2019s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose\u2019s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don\u2019t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45\u2019s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they\u2019re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don\u2019t work out, but I would imagine they\u2019d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45\u2019s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5\u2019s require using the app, the Sonos don\u2019t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don\u2019t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I\u2019ve found that to be accurate.  While that\u2019s less than the Sonos and Sony\u2019s battery life (30 hours), it\u2019s more than the Apple\u2019s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45\u2019s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there\u2019s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you\u2019re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!",

        "review": "I bought the ultras on the black friday sale last week and while the noise cancellation was amazing, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the features in the app, the touch volume control on the side, the heavy headset, etc. I decided to try these out and I\u2019m SO glad I did. Personally I find these way more comfortable on my head and I think they\u2019re a bit lighter. The noise cancellation is still great - the ultras maybe block out 5% more but have that hissing NC noise way louder which I didn\u2019t like. This still blocks out sound really well and plenty enough for me. I\u2019m not on flights or in loud places that often so for me it\u2019s more about blocking out background noise at home which it does excellently. If you don\u2019t need the spatial audio, immersion modes, extreme NC, and high tech features of the ultra I honestly would go with these. They were much cheaper (got these on cyber monday sale and were nearly $150 less than the ultras) and I personally prefer them. Love the simple and user friendly controls too. I\u2019m a millennial and good with tech, but sometimes it\u2019s too much and too gimmicky. These are great though and you can really tell a difference between the aware and quiet modes. It\u2019s very nice having that option. I hope they last for years to come!",

        "review": "I\u2019m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a \u201cgeneral audience\u2019s\u201d needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn\u2019t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you\u2019re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they\u2019re lighter and they don\u2019t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5\u20192 woman. I don\u2019t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won\u2019t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I\u2019ve googled it\u2019s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I\u2019m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn\u2019t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven\u2019t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it\u2019s on the end of the person you\u2019re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn\u2019t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don\u2019t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It\u2019s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they\u2019re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can\u2019t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there\u2019s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.",

        "review": "First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don\u2019t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort\u2019s buttons to the Ultra\u2019s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45\u2019s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5\u2019s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm\u2019s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5\u2019s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they\u2019re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45\u2019s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose\u2019s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don\u2019t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45\u2019s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they\u2019re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don\u2019t work out, but I would imagine they\u2019d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45\u2019s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5\u2019s require using the app, the Sonos don\u2019t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don\u2019t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I\u2019ve found that to be accurate.  While that\u2019s less than the Sonos and Sony\u2019s battery life (30 hours), it\u2019s more than the Apple\u2019s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45\u2019s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there\u2019s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you\u2019re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!",

        "review": "I bought the ultras on the black friday sale last week and while the noise cancellation was amazing, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the features in the app, the touch volume control on the side, the heavy headset, etc. I decided to try these out and I\u2019m SO glad I did. Personally I find these way more comfortable on my head and I think they\u2019re a bit lighter. The noise cancellation is still great - the ultras maybe block out 5% more but have that hissing NC noise way louder which I didn\u2019t like. This still blocks out sound really well and plenty enough for me. I\u2019m not on flights or in loud places that often so for me it\u2019s more about blocking out background noise at home which it does excellently. If you don\u2019t need the spatial audio, immersion modes, extreme NC, and high tech features of the ultra I honestly would go with these. They were much cheaper (got these on cyber monday sale and were nearly $150 less than the ultras) and I personally prefer them. Love the simple and user friendly controls too. I\u2019m a millennial and good with tech, but sometimes it\u2019s too much and too gimmicky. These are great though and you can really tell a difference between the aware and quiet modes. It\u2019s very nice having that option. I hope they last for years to come!",

        "review": "Comfortable and easy to wear for hours without my ears hurting. Sony has nailed the design for long term wear for all wireless Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Does not fall out easily and fits ergonomically. I am confident I won't lose these easily. I love the large button pressed to control music, calls, etc. I enjoy that it's not touch-sensitive like Samsung earbuds, which have been falsely set off by my hair or beanie. My complaints: these buttons are not programmable: what type of madman want people to press 4 times to change volume up/down? I would also love a \"Find Earbuds\" function if they are connected to a device, but the owner isn't sure where they placed them.Noise cancellation is non-existent, but you have ambient sound (listen to your surroundings) if you wish to have both music and some situational awareness. The case is *slim*, much slimmer than Sony's previous cases. Sound is very decent for the price. With the latest iterations of Bluetooth, these earbuds can be connected to 2 devices at a time, but they cannot play sound from both sources at once. All in all, I recommend if you need a decent and comfortable pair of earbuds with which to listen to music and audio for hours. Sometimes, I use them for more than 6 hours and I'm surprised the battery still goes strong. I've been using them for 5 months now, and like other Sony earbuds I've owned in the past, I expect their longevity to last years.",

        "review": "1) The sound of the WF-C510 is really good right out of the box without EQ. I listen to a lot of music, various genres, and everything is balanced and in control. Punchy bass, treble that's crisp and doesn't make my ears bleed, and decent mids. I definitely trust Sony when it comes to audio products.2) Fit and comfort are amazing! I can leave these in all day. No joke, after 5+ hours of use, I feel zero discomfort. Not only are these earbuds the most comfortable earbuds of all time, but getting a good in-ear seal is effortless. Just set them and forget them, zero hassle. Just to note, there's no ANC but I don't mind; I use these at home where it's already quiet. Further, there's a feature called Ambient Sound Control, kind of the opposite of ANC, that lets outside noises in (press button on left earbud). Obviously, the volume has to be pretty low for this feature to be useful.3) I rarely ever use playback controls on a pair of earbuds, as I just use my phone for that stuff. However, the physical buttons on the WF-C510 work like they should and it's always nice to have actual buttons over touch controls, mainly because there's less chance for accidental inputs, a common occurrence on my other earbuds.4) The battery life seems to jive with Sony's claims of 11 hours in the buds and another 11 in the case. I'm getting a 50% battery level after 5+ hours at a volume level above half with the \"Sony Sound Connect\" app installed on my phone. I'll admit, the 11 hour battery claim was the #1 factor for my purchase.5) The app gives you a ton of stuff to play around with. There's a bunch of EQs, 360 audio (more app downloads and payment required, I think), information regarding battery levels, and more.6) A couple of oddities: The charging case confuses me. Does the orange light turn off when charging is complete or does it stay lit? I've experienced both scenarios and both times the app said the earbuds and case were at 100%. The instruction manual was no help. Also, for some reason I had to re-pair the earbuds to my phone's Bluetooth after shutting it off, which was super annoying. I was testing to see if an older device (without the app) would pair, so to avoid interference I turned off my phone's Bluetooth. The older device paired with the earbuds just fine without the app, so it isn't required. I plan on deleting it; it's probably a major battery hog anyway.7) Minor issues aside, the Sony WF-C510 delivers premium comfort and pleasing sound. and they're super affordable. Get yours today! lolUpdate 3/25 -- Checking in to mention that the orange charging light on the case does in fact shut off to indicate that charging is complete and I'm still very happy with my purchase.",

I haven\u2019t had any issues with the mic during phone calls; I am told I sound clear.I use them at work. They pair with my computer and my phone at the same time. That\u2019s one of the main reasons I bought these. The audio quality is really good. Way better than my AirPod pro 1st gen. I like the EQ settings on the app. Battery life is never a worry for me. I can go a few days with a full charge.Only a few complaints. One is the app should have a setting where it lets you customize what the taps do.Second is when on call, it goes into transparency mode which I don\u2019t like but not a deal breaker.Overall for the price I paid I would recommend these. I will update my review if I have any issues.",

        "review": "Comfortable and easy to wear for hours without my ears hurting. Sony has nailed the design for long term wear for all wireless Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Does not fall out easily and fits ergonomically. I am confident I won't lose these easily. I love the large button pressed to control music, calls, etc. I enjoy that it's not touch-sensitive like Samsung earbuds, which have been falsely set off by my hair or beanie. My complaints: these buttons are not programmable: what type of madman want people to press 4 times to change volume up/down? I would also love a \"Find Earbuds\" function if they are connected to a device, but the owner isn't sure where they placed them.Noise cancellation is non-existent, but you have ambient sound (listen to your surroundings) if you wish to have both music and some situational awareness. The case is *slim*, much slimmer than Sony's previous cases. Sound is very decent for the price. With the latest iterations of Bluetooth, these earbuds can be connected to 2 devices at a time, but they cannot play sound from both sources at once. All in all, I recommend if you need a decent and comfortable pair of earbuds with which to listen to music and audio for hours. Sometimes, I use them for more than 6 hours and I'm surprised the battery still goes strong. I've been using them for 5 months now, and like other Sony earbuds I've owned in the past, I expect their longevity to last years.",

        "review": "1) The sound of the WF-C510 is really good right out of the box without EQ. I listen to a lot of music, various genres, and everything is balanced and in control. Punchy bass, treble that's crisp and doesn't make my ears bleed, and decent mids. I definitely trust Sony when it comes to audio products.2) Fit and comfort are amazing! I can leave these in all day. No joke, after 5+ hours of use, I feel zero discomfort. Not only are these earbuds the most comfortable earbuds of all time, but getting a good in-ear seal is effortless. Just set them and forget them, zero hassle. Just to note, there's no ANC but I don't mind; I use these at home where it's already quiet. Further, there's a feature called Ambient Sound Control, kind of the opposite of ANC, that lets outside noises in (press button on left earbud). Obviously, the volume has to be pretty low for this feature to be useful.3) I rarely ever use playback controls on a pair of earbuds, as I just use my phone for that stuff. However, the physical buttons on the WF-C510 work like they should and it's always nice to have actual buttons over touch controls, mainly because there's less chance for accidental inputs, a common occurrence on my other earbuds.4) The battery life seems to jive with Sony's claims of 11 hours in the buds and another 11 in the case. I'm getting a 50% battery level after 5+ hours at a volume level above half with the \"Sony Sound Connect\" app installed on my phone. I'll admit, the 11 hour battery claim was the #1 factor for my purchase.5) The app gives you a ton of stuff to play around with. There's a bunch of EQs, 360 audio (more app downloads and payment required, I think), information regarding battery levels, and more.6) A couple of oddities: The charging case confuses me. Does the orange light turn off when charging is complete or does it stay lit? I've experienced both scenarios and both times the app said the earbuds and case were at 100%. The instruction manual was no help. Also, for some reason I had to re-pair the earbuds to my phone's Bluetooth after shutting it off, which was super annoying. I was testing to see if an older device (without the app) would pair, so to avoid interference I turned off my phone's Bluetooth. The older device paired with the earbuds just fine without the app, so it isn't required. I plan on deleting it; it's probably a major battery hog anyway.7) Minor issues aside, the Sony WF-C510 delivers premium comfort and pleasing sound. and they're super affordable. Get yours today! lolUpdate 3/25 -- Checking in to mention that the orange charging light on the case does in fact shut off to indicate that charging is complete and I'm still very happy with my purchase.",

The problem is that my ears are very sensitive, and most earbuds become uncomfortable after a short time. I needed something light, with good sound, and above all, that I could wear for hours without pain.That's when I found these professional Bluetooth earbuds. From the moment I opened the box, I knew the comfort was real. They have an ergonomic design and come with different ear tips, which allowed me to find the perfect fit. It's crazy, sometimes I forget I'm wearing them!.Beyond comfort, the sound is fantastic. I'm not an audio expert, but the lows are clear and the highs are crisp. For my work calls, the Bluetooth connection is super fast and stable, and the microphone quality is excellent; my colleagues hear me perfectly. The promise of \"hassle-free control\" is totally delivered, the syncing with my phone was instantaneous.",

But, if you use them for phone calls, alternating earbuds will in fact give you 80 hours of continuous use.The designers of the GOLREX earbuds have thought of everything and packed great features into these buds.Overall, these are a great addition to my accessories. \u00a0The price is fair, but with the current 50% off coupon, it is a great price.Oh, and by the way, don\u2019t forget to register your purchase and you get a lifetime warranty!",

        "review": "I'd used many models in the Samsung Galaxy Buds lineup, the last being a couple pairs of the Buds 2 Pros. While I liked the Samung earbuds, I put about 30 hours of use on the headphones weekly and they never held up for more than 3 or 4 months. One earbud (most always the right) would lose volume and quality until it failed to produce listenable sound at all. I'd use the Samung warranty, then the extended warranty that I'd purchased, then buy another pair and start over. Which each new model I'd hoped Samung had fixed the durability issues, but they never had, so I finally decided to try something new.In comes the Method 360s. I've been using these guys for nearly a year now and they haven't lost sound volume or quality in the slightest. While the higher frequencies might not be quite as clear or expansive as the Buds 2 Pros, I think they sound great for the price and I love their punchy bass. The volume on the highest setting also seems to be a little louder than other earbuds that I've had, which can be nice.I'm not impressed with their ANC. I hardly notice it compared to my Bose over-the-ear headphones, but it's not an issue when paired with their passive noise cancelation and I wasn't impressed with the Buds 2 Pros ANC, either. I have some connectivity issues here and there where one bud won't pair with my Samsung phone out of the case. I'll put the earbud back in the case and take it out again and then I'm good to go. I've never lost Bluetooth connection once paired.All in all, I think these are good buds for a good priceI finally decided to try something else and that's where these",

The case is a bit weird it's a long case that slides up and down and each side is marked with R and L to tell which side each earbud goes to. The positives are the sound is amazing and anc is very good I use them at 40 to 50 percent volume and it blocks out a lot of sound. The charging is pretty fast about 20 minutes and I get an hour and some minutes back to listen to them again and these are very comfortable and come with 3 size options and are able it a good amount of colors to purchase and it has an option to connect to your email for fast connection to any device that uses that certain email which is cool. Another great thing is single earbud can use anc option which I use daily since my job only allows one earbud in and works great.Negatives are small in my opinion one is the battery life is a lie with anc on it lasts about 6.5 hours not 9 like it was registered on the list and I know because I usually work long shifts and about half way I have to charge up and second issue is with both earbuds in is stuttering this comes up at small intervals and it's annoying hearing skips in songs or video if you're in crowded place or on a walk and I think it has to do with Bluetooth connection not going through multiple channels and skull app is useless so I tried to fix by using their methods to attempt a fix and it still happens so I think it's a bad Bluetooth connection and I looked online and seen other people complaining about this issue.So in the end if skullcandy could fix the connection stutters and their own app to get this small issue to go away I would rate them 5 out 5 but it ain't it gots some issues like I mentioned above but it's like a good alternative to a cheaper version of the Bose QC earbuds II",

The fitment is snug and no need for readjustment during my 1.5 hour gym sessions which also includes running the treadmill. The earbud silicone pieces do not get stuck in my ears or slide off the earbuds at all. I'm assuming people who complain about the silicone coming off/undone must be user error or improperly installed.Bluetooth connection for me has been solid on my Google Pixel 7 Pro, including my friends iPhone 16 Pro Max. I did download the Skullcandy IQ app which prompt me for an update that I did. No connectivity issues at all so far.My battery life is currently at 97% with 3 days worth of gym use at about 1.5hrs per day at medium to medium/high volume with ANC turned off (from fully charged).The case is on the bulky side, however, it's easy to use. People complaining about how difficult/annoying it is to put the earbuds back in the case are simple minded. All you have to do is literally look at the orientation of the ear buds upon removal and put them back the exact same way. I guess people need something to complain about.I'd absolutely recommend these earbuds, especially over the air pods, beats, or SoundCloud. Wait for a sale or buy them used like I did.",

Their sound, battery, controls, feel, fit, and in app support is all very solid.Let\u2019s start with the pros.Sound quality is clean with an emphasis on the low and on highs, so a bit of a V Shape tuning. The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn\u2019t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price. I love the magnet on them since Baseus products usually have a strong magnet to them.Now for the cons.Sound quality is great, superb even, but the classics bass thump is lacking a bit. I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn\u2019t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have. The XH1\u2019s have it, and so it was mildly surprising to see these didn\u2019t have it.Fit is good, but it could definitely be better. With light use and not as heavy a move, they wouldn\u2019t fall out, but if I were to exercise, these would most likely slip. The limited use of 3 eartips definitely does not help.App Support could also be better. The Dolby Audio isn\u2019t the best and custom EQ doesn\u2019t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from. They sound quieter and a bit more flat. Also, as mentioned the above, the lack of bass boost button is upsetting.Overall, my experience with these have been positive so far and will keep testing them out.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

        "review": "These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

        "review": "First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I\u2019ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem \u2013 only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they\u2019re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I\u2019ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I\u2019ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to \u201cstay alive\u201d.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it\u2019s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",

        "review": "I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)I went with these two because1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.Let's start with jlabI'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..Bose.Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???How do they sound so much better?!I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale. I would like to have them in my collection for when I just need some good headbanging. Both headphones are great, but get the one you need for the life you live. Take care!",

        "review": "I rarely write reviews, due to lack of time and the fact that if a product performs the way it's supposed to, it doesn't deserve my time to review it. For the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, I will make an exception.Simply put, they are wonderful - the sound, the noise cancelling, the ease of fit and comfort.  A solid product all around.  I have never been a big Bose fan.  I thought their products were good, but not great and overpriced.  I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace my old faithful Jabra 65T Elites that finally died. They were nearly 4 years old and didn't owe me anything.  Based on reviews, I tried the Apple AirPod Pro 2nd gen, the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose.I was interested in the AirPods mostly because of their compatibility with my Iphone and my son's recommendation. I returned them for three reasons.  First, to get them to fit with a tight seal was an ordeal.  Fifteen minutes of futzing around to finally pass the seal test (and that's with Comply foam tips -- the Apple silicone tips didn't work for me period.) And even after passing the seal test, I did not find the ANC particularly effective.  Adjusting the volume by sliding my finger up and down the stem was wonky -- not working, pausing the music or shifting the bud, the seal I worked so hard to get, broke. Also, not having a real equalizer is a drawback. Apple has a customization wizard, but I like to have different settings for different genres of music.  The customization wizard uses Apple's own sound track.On to the Sony's.  I liked the Sony's.  I have the WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones for serious listening and they are great.  But they are not suitable to wear for dog walking, bike rides or the gym.  I need earbuds.  The over the ears are also bulky to take on airplane flights taking up a lot real estate in my string pack or messenger bag. Anyway, I tried the 1000XM5's and liked them.  The sound is very good as is the ANC.  The three drawbacks are ease of fit, comfort and volume control.  While easier to pass the seal fit test than the apples, it still took more futzing around than I care to do. Also, to pass the seal test, I had to use the large tips which hurt my ears after an hour.  Finally, the four tap volume control is a pain.  I either got know response or went back a track because I only tapped three times.So on to the Bose. Nirvana.Fit and Comfort.  So easy to get a fit with their innovative tip and wing combo.  The wings are really a small silicone gasket that fit inside your ear, but outside the ear canal. Select the right combo of tip and wing (sized independently) put them in your ear and you pass the fit test, first time, every time.  I hardly feel them in my ears.Sound Quality.  Superb. The Bose bathe me with aural warmth.  I liked the Sony sound until I listened to the Bose.  I would characterize the sound as warm but accurate.  The Sony sound is like sunlight.  The Bose sound is like an incandescent lamp.  Despite the warmth, the sound is always clean and bright when it needs to be.  I listen to a very wide range of music and the sound has been great for every genre. I think that classical music really tests the quality of an audio product due to the tonal range of instruments and voices and the variety of textures.  Listening to Mozart's Requiem was sublime. It was like falling in love all over again.  The immersion sound option raises the sound quality to a whole new level, bringing a depth and presence to the music. Just wow. And unlike the spatial music technology of Sony and Apple, immersion works for all sources. What I said about Mozart applies to any rock, jazz, and Latin that I have thrown out them. I've heard sounds, I've never heard before. The Bose app has a basic equalizer but I leave everything flat.ANC:  Can't be beat.  I can listen to quiet music while my wife is watching TV and it doesn't bother me.  Sharp sounds such as a firecracker breakthrough but it's not a sensory deprivation chamber after all.  I remember the early days of ANC -- it deadened the sound.  Not these buds.  The sound is alive and well.  Can't wait to take them on my first flight in two weeks.  And the aware mode is terrific.  Just switch to aware and have a conversation without taking the buds out or when using them while on a bike ride.Controls:  Work really well and sliding you finger to increase/decrease volume is easy, unlike my experience with the AirPod Pros.  I learned that the double and triple taps to move forwards and backwards between tracks does not have to be super rapid. Overall, the touch controls work as well as the physical controls of my old Jabra's.Phone calls: Very secondary for me but so far they have worked just fine.  I hear voices clearly and it seems that I am easily understood.Battery Life -- The only weakness- 4 hours with immersion on but I'm told with moderate volume, you can eke out 5 hours, enough for a cross country flight. And I will keep my over the ear Sony's up top in my carry on if I need them.  I am not too concerned.  Not concerned enough to take take a star off.Everybody's tastes are different.  Some folks will be wed to Apple and it's ecosystem and the buds are $50 less.  Sony has better battery life.  But for me, Bose wins hands down for the combination of fit, comfort, sound quality, ANC and controls.",

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.

The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.  Would be nice to maybe have better water and/or dust resistance...",

The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

        "review": "I've used many, many different pairs of earbuds. Most with active noise cancellation, and I can honestly say these are the best by a mile! I used them in a variaty of enviroments from a noisy office space, on a plan, and at home with the constant noise of my kids and their toys. Every time you put them in your ears, you're presented with a symponic sound that tunes the earbuds and checks the seal to your ear. It helps make the noise canceling feature work the best I've ever heard! I have a white noise machine that helps my wife sleep at night, and these buds can block out that sound 100% on its loudest setting! That way, when she's trying to sleep, I can watch some streaming content without the sound of anything in the background, making it easy to hear the smallest sound in what you're watching, like someone breathing in a quiet, tense moment, even when there's a bunch of noise all around you. The Bose app is great too! it makes it easy to customize the use of the earbuds, manage the devices they are connected to, and adjust the EQ and noise cancellation feature. The spartial audio feature makes it seem like you are listening in a large concert hall vs. a set of earbuds. You must try it when you get your pair! You can find it in the \"immersion\" menu in the Bose app on your phone. The earbuds fit very securely in your ear. There are enough fit pieces in the box to fit almost any ear shape. I love that the V2 has so many colors to choose from. I went with the black/gold version, and I love the way they look! overall, I give these a 5/5! well worh the money!",

        "review": "I have an Android phone and I was using a different earbuds which unfortunately Im unable to use all the features it touted. So I needed an earbuds that aside from comfort I'm able to use all capabilities. I've had other Bose products and I was fairly confident that Bose wouldn't let me down. I'm happy to say that yay, I got my money's worth! The sound quality was impressive and the sample audio clip that Bose had during the setup phase really showed that off. I like that it had all these different features in there, Still Immersion, etc. So of course, I listed to my own songs and it was great. Noise cancelling was superb in my honest opinion. I heard the difference when it is on and off. I didn't hear my Mom when she was talking with the earbuds on and I'm like duh! i have the earbuds on lol. This was without any sound on so my Mom's voice was so distant and far away. I also tested the Bose with my work laptop as I conduct video meetings and again I'm very happy with it. My coworkers did not complain that they couldn't hear me so it looks like the mic placement in the Bose is great. I'm happy to no longer use my big headphones with the sticking out microphone. By the way, the Bose was Bluetooth connected to my two devices, my Android Phone and work laptop and there was no issue to start using the work laptop for the video meetings so that was very convenient. In regard to fit, I did not change the pads. It looks like medium is my size, and so far, I have not experienced any pain in my ear from wearing it too long. I've had it on for about an hour. I will have to continue to observe if I experience any pain if I wear it for more than an hour. The case itself is pretty portable, in my opinion, and it is not slippery \u2014 which I love because I don\u2019t feel the need to purchase a case cover. This uses a USB-C and has wireless charging, and both so far have worked flawlessly. In conclusion, I totally recommend these Bose earbuds. I am using it for both work and personal reasons and so Im definitely getting the bang out of my buck.",

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.  The best low cost alternative I tried are the Soundpeats pearl clips - great value for the money.  For call quality, it wasn't a huge priority for me.  The few calls I've made worked fine without complaints.Overall, here are my Pros:+ Best sound quality by far in this category - smooth, responsive, and WIDE sound stage+ Extremely comfortable - I can wear these all day and not notice+ Value - more expensive than the value segment, but also not exceedingly expensive esp. when on sale.  Well worth the additional money.+ Styling - these have more of a sporty/tech look than the others.  To me, they look less like earings and more like buds.  I never loved the look of the earing style.+ App - clean app with all the features I actually needCons- Call quality?  Not yet for me and also not a huge priority, but I'll trust what others have said- Is there a v2 in the works?  it seems like every other brand has released 2-3 updated versions in the time Bose released these.  I was holding out to see if Bose would release a v2, but that hasn't happened and they're so far ahead of competitors I'm not sure they even need to.

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

I watched reviews and demo'd many others.  I've stayed away from the Bose because of reviews saying they were overpriced or because competitors were just as good (or close to as good).  i wish i tried these for myself a year ago, because i can now say this position is completely wrong.  none of the options sound anywhere close to as good as the Bose. if sound quality is your top priority then don't get convinced into buying an inferior product for a gimmicky feature.the bose have nailed the open sound - it's a wide and dynamic sound stage vs. others that sound either too shrill, hollow, or missing low end.  I'm surprised at how well these manage bass response especially in quiet environments - they sound exactly how you'd expect Bose to sound.  It seems like the biggest criticisms these get are the price, which is understandable, and phone call mic quality.  i was able to get these on sale, and if you're anywhere in the ballpark on price vs. alternatives, i would pay the premium and get these.  The best low cost alternative I tried are the Soundpeats pearl clips - great value for the money.  For call quality, it wasn't a huge priority for me.

The sound is crisp, clear and loud and the fit is majorly comfy. I\u2019m undecided on the quality of the microphone. In iMessage voice notes it suppresses too much and in other apps it sounds fine. Could be a setting in missing somewhere to adjust the noise suppression on the mic. Otherwise. AMAZING.",

Price is hard to beat.Cons:If you have the Noise Cancelling on i cannot get 8 hours of use before they need a charge. If you look carefully, just after the \"40 hours of use\" there is a note that this is if NC is off, that may be true, testing this now.Overall:Great earbuds. I love the JBL line and these for the cost are a great product.",

The only drawback (and it's a very small drawback) is the noise canceling is not quite as good as on my last pair of these. It's still acceptable though. For example, I have a soft top jeep and the ANC feature doesn't quite drown out the wind noise. To end the review these are an excellent product for the price point.",

        "review": "As a previous owner the Baseus MC1 Pro, I already had high expectations for the XC1.The MC1 Pro sounded great and was very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately I lost them by accident.Having experienced the quality of the Baseus sound product, I had good feelings about purchasing the higher tier XC1.The XC1 certainly did not disappoint. Right out of the box, you can feel that the build quality and design are one step above the MC1 Pro. It absolutely feel like a premium product just by holding them in your hand.The Bose calibrated sound is also a step up from the MC2 Pro, with more pronounced bass and better clarity. The max volume is also higher which helps in noisy environments. The additional EQ presets from the app are also very useful.You get the same level of comfort wearing them - they are so light that you sometimes can't even feel them on your ears. The battery last forever and even when you run out, it takes just a few minutes in the case to recharge enough for a few more hours.Overall, this is an amazing product. For the build quality, sound quality, style and comfort, it is almost impossible to beat in this price range.",

        "review": "Ok, so this review is specifically for using these while running because that is the sole purpose that I purchased them for and all of my insights will relate to that.Let me start with all of the good things about these:1) They sound really good. In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "Baseus really hit a homerun with these. I was a little skeptical at first just from the clip on design itself and the fact that most clipons ive tried have left me feeling disappointed. But these are an absolute MUST buy for anyone looking for a clip on.The sound is awesome, at low volume (30% or so) they do a great job of still being clearly audible and having a bass that is still present. Once you crank it up to 70-80 they definitely pump out some nice sound. Top that off with the nice soft rubber grips and a sturdy fit you have yourself not only a comfortable earbud but a great WORKOUT earbud.The battery life is good as well, i went a whole session with volume at about 60% and got almost 9 hours from them which is insane. The button on each earbud can be customized with many options to choose from which is nice too. I haven't necessarily used them for calls specifically but ended up using them on a discord call and got zero complaints so i assume they must be fine as well.Overall these are easy to recommend for anyone interested in clip ons and especially as a gift option.",

        "review": "I just purchased these Baseus open ear buds to replace my old Jlab ones. So far they are great. I primarily use them for music listening while still being able to pick up outside sounds and keep mobile. The Bose bass sounds excellent with no distortion. They are lightweight and comfortable with thoughtful little rubber nubs where they come in contact with your ears. Buttons work fine. I personally like the open ear ring type buds. They look like some kind of cyber-tribal piercing thing, which works for me. I still wish they\u2019d invent an accessory miniature subwoofer that clips into your nostrils through.Update 12/25: After a couple of months I\u2019m still liken\u2019 these ear bud. My only issues are the little control buttons. The \u2018feel\u2019 of the buttons when pressed doesn\u2019t do it for me. It\u2019s hard to tell when you\u2019re activating a command. I have a feeling these will not last  in prolonged use. Also the buttons would be better bigger and maybe knurled rubber caps for easier use. I should also mention that the charger case is horrible. It\u2019s larger than the cheaper Jlab one that this replaced and very, very difficult to open. It needs a recessed finger groove or something.",

        "review": "First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5\u2019s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don\u2019t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort\u2019s buttons to the Ultra\u2019s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45\u2019s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45\u2019s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5\u2019s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm\u2019s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5\u2019s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they\u2019re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45\u2019s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose\u2019s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don\u2019t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45\u2019s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they\u2019re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don\u2019t work out, but I would imagine they\u2019d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45\u2019s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5\u2019s require using the app, the Sonos don\u2019t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don\u2019t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I\u2019ve found that to be accurate.  While that\u2019s less than the Sonos and Sony\u2019s battery life (30 hours), it\u2019s more than the Apple\u2019s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45\u2019s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there\u2019s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you\u2019re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!",

        "review": "I bought the ultras on the black friday sale last week and while the noise cancellation was amazing, I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the features in the app, the touch volume control on the side, the heavy headset, etc. I decided to try these out and I\u2019m SO glad I did. Personally I find these way more comfortable on my head and I think they\u2019re a bit lighter. The noise cancellation is still great - the ultras maybe block out 5% more but have that hissing NC noise way louder which I didn\u2019t like. This still blocks out sound really well and plenty enough for me. I\u2019m not on flights or in loud places that often so for me it\u2019s more about blocking out background noise at home which it does excellently. If you don\u2019t need the spatial audio, immersion modes, extreme NC, and high tech features of the ultra I honestly would go with these. They were much cheaper (got these on cyber monday sale and were nearly $150 less than the ultras) and I personally prefer them. Love the simple and user friendly controls too. I\u2019m a millennial and good with tech, but sometimes it\u2019s too much and too gimmicky. These are great though and you can really tell a difference between the aware and quiet modes. It\u2019s very nice having that option. I hope they last for years to come!",

        "review": "I\u2019m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a \u201cgeneral audience\u2019s\u201d needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn\u2019t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you\u2019re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they\u2019re lighter and they don\u2019t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5\u20192 woman. I don\u2019t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won\u2019t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I\u2019ve googled it\u2019s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I\u2019m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn\u2019t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven\u2019t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it\u2019s on the end of the person you\u2019re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn\u2019t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don\u2019t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It\u2019s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they\u2019re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can\u2019t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there\u2019s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.",

Too the user input is again limited which isn't a huge deal but disappointed when it's inconvenient. Also a big tell of the heavy use is the capacitance of the battery is very poor and after a year failing to maintain a charge",

        "review": "I'd used many models in the Samsung Galaxy Buds lineup, the last being a couple pairs of the Buds 2 Pros. While I liked the Samung earbuds, I put about 30 hours of use on the headphones weekly and they never held up for more than 3 or 4 months. One earbud (most always the right) would lose volume and quality until it failed to produce listenable sound at all. I'd use the Samung warranty, then the extended warranty that I'd purchased, then buy another pair and start over. Which each new model I'd hoped Samung had fixed the durability issues, but they never had, so I finally decided to try something new.In comes the Method 360s. I've been using these guys for nearly a year now and they haven't lost sound volume or quality in the slightest. While the higher frequencies might not be quite as clear or expansive as the Buds 2 Pros, I think they sound great for the price and I love their punchy bass. The volume on the highest setting also seems to be a little louder than other earbuds that I've had, which can be nice.I'm not impressed with their ANC. I hardly notice it compared to my Bose over-the-ear headphones, but it's not an issue when paired with their passive noise cancelation and I wasn't impressed with the Buds 2 Pros ANC, either. I have some connectivity issues here and there where one bud won't pair with my Samsung phone out of the case. I'll put the earbud back in the case and take it out again and then I'm good to go. I've never lost Bluetooth connection once paired.All in all, I think these are good buds for a good priceI finally decided to try something else and that's where these",

The case is a bit weird it's a long case that slides up and down and each side is marked with R and L to tell which side each earbud goes to. The positives are the sound is amazing and anc is very good I use them at 40 to 50 percent volume and it blocks out a lot of sound. The charging is pretty fast about 20 minutes and I get an hour and some minutes back to listen to them again and these are very comfortable and come with 3 size options and are able it a good amount of colors to purchase and it has an option to connect to your email for fast connection to any device that uses that certain email which is cool. Another great thing is single earbud can use anc option which I use daily since my job only allows one earbud in and works great.Negatives are small in my opinion one is the battery life is a lie with anc on it lasts about 6.5 hours not 9 like it was registered on the list and I know because I usually work long shifts and about half way I have to charge up and second issue is with both earbuds in is stuttering this comes up at small intervals and it's annoying hearing skips in songs or video if you're in crowded place or on a walk and I think it has to do with Bluetooth connection not going through multiple channels and skull app is useless so I tried to fix by using their methods to attempt a fix and it still happens so I think it's a bad Bluetooth connection and I looked online and seen other people complaining about this issue.So in the end if skullcandy could fix the connection stutters and their own app to get this small issue to go away I would rate them 5 out 5 but it ain't it gots some issues like I mentioned above but it's like a good alternative to a cheaper version of the Bose QC earbuds II",

The fitment is snug and no need for readjustment during my 1.5 hour gym sessions which also includes running the treadmill. The earbud silicone pieces do not get stuck in my ears or slide off the earbuds at all. I'm assuming people who complain about the silicone coming off/undone must be user error or improperly installed.Bluetooth connection for me has been solid on my Google Pixel 7 Pro, including my friends iPhone 16 Pro Max. I did download the Skullcandy IQ app which prompt me for an update that I did. No connectivity issues at all so far.My battery life is currently at 97% with 3 days worth of gym use at about 1.5hrs per day at medium to medium/high volume with ANC turned off (from fully charged).The case is on the bulky side, however, it's easy to use. People complaining about how difficult/annoying it is to put the earbuds back in the case are simple minded. All you have to do is literally look at the orientation of the ear buds upon removal and put them back the exact same way. I guess people need something to complain about.I'd absolutely recommend these earbuds, especially over the air pods, beats, or SoundCloud. Wait for a sale or buy them used like I did.",

        "review": "Comfortable and easy to wear for hours without my ears hurting. Sony has nailed the design for long term wear for all wireless Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Does not fall out easily and fits ergonomically. I am confident I won't lose these easily. I love the large button pressed to control music, calls, etc. I enjoy that it's not touch-sensitive like Samsung earbuds, which have been falsely set off by my hair or beanie. My complaints: these buttons are not programmable: what type of madman want people to press 4 times to change volume up/down? I would also love a \"Find Earbuds\" function if they are connected to a device, but the owner isn't sure where they placed them.Noise cancellation is non-existent, but you have ambient sound (listen to your surroundings) if you wish to have both music and some situational awareness. The case is *slim*, much slimmer than Sony's previous cases. Sound is very decent for the price. With the latest iterations of Bluetooth, these earbuds can be connected to 2 devices at a time, but they cannot play sound from both sources at once. All in all, I recommend if you need a decent and comfortable pair of earbuds with which to listen to music and audio for hours. Sometimes, I use them for more than 6 hours and I'm surprised the battery still goes strong. I've been using them for 5 months now, and like other Sony earbuds I've owned in the past, I expect their longevity to last years.",

        "review": "1) The sound of the WF-C510 is really good right out of the box without EQ. I listen to a lot of music, various genres, and everything is balanced and in control. Punchy bass, treble that's crisp and doesn't make my ears bleed, and decent mids. I definitely trust Sony when it comes to audio products.2) Fit and comfort are amazing! I can leave these in all day. No joke, after 5+ hours of use, I feel zero discomfort. Not only are these earbuds the most comfortable earbuds of all time, but getting a good in-ear seal is effortless. Just set them and forget them, zero hassle. Just to note, there's no ANC but I don't mind; I use these at home where it's already quiet. Further, there's a feature called Ambient Sound Control, kind of the opposite of ANC, that lets outside noises in (press button on left earbud). Obviously, the volume has to be pretty low for this feature to be useful.3) I rarely ever use playback controls on a pair of earbuds, as I just use my phone for that stuff. However, the physical buttons on the WF-C510 work like they should and it's always nice to have actual buttons over touch controls, mainly because there's less chance for accidental inputs, a common occurrence on my other earbuds.4) The battery life seems to jive with Sony's claims of 11 hours in the buds and another 11 in the case. I'm getting a 50% battery level after 5+ hours at a volume level above half with the \"Sony Sound Connect\" app installed on my phone. I'll admit, the 11 hour battery claim was the #1 factor for my purchase.5) The app gives you a ton of stuff to play around with. There's a bunch of EQs, 360 audio (more app downloads and payment required, I think), information regarding battery levels, and more.6) A couple of oddities: The charging case confuses me. Does the orange light turn off when charging is complete or does it stay lit? I've experienced both scenarios and both times the app said the earbuds and case were at 100%. The instruction manual was no help. Also, for some reason I had to re-pair the earbuds to my phone's Bluetooth after shutting it off, which was super annoying. I was testing to see if an older device (without the app) would pair, so to avoid interference I turned off my phone's Bluetooth. The older device paired with the earbuds just fine without the app, so it isn't required. I plan on deleting it; it's probably a major battery hog anyway.7) Minor issues aside, the Sony WF-C510 delivers premium comfort and pleasing sound. and they're super affordable. Get yours today! lolUpdate 3/25 -- Checking in to mention that the orange charging light on the case does in fact shut off to indicate that charging is complete and I'm still very happy with my purchase.",

        "review": "My experience with the Sony (WF-C510) has been great. They are not too bulky to carry around.  Their transparency mode is solid. They don\u2019t have a noise canceling mode but just wearing the buds block out a good amount of noise. They are comfortable and fit right in and have never fell out on their own. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the mic during phone calls; I am told I sound clear.I use them at work. They pair with my computer and my phone at the same time. That\u2019s one of the main reasons I bought these. The audio quality is really good. Way better than my AirPod pro 1st gen. I like the EQ settings on the app. Battery life is never a worry for me. I can go a few days with a full charge.Only a few complaints. One is the app should have a setting where it lets you customize what the taps do.Second is when on call, it goes into transparency mode which I don\u2019t like but not a deal breaker.Overall for the price I paid I would recommend these. I will update my review if I have any issues.",

        "review": "These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a \"beep\" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.",

        "review": "I work in a dental lab and I have bad noise sensitivity issues. Bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other ear buds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did and good lord the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block SO MUCH. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and the cool little bands they have around the bud keeps them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh NOTHING. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (android). They are VERY sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip or go back.Music and audio books sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had including Sony's has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace.On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it and twice it stopped syncing.  I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud so if I was taking the left one out first ( I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right on out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the, battery at blah blah percent prompt then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in and I have never had another problem and I waited a over solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life altering product that has made an ENORMOUS difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of NOISE.On battery life. At work I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me.  I am there for 9 hours.In my opinion these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running.

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running.

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

        "review": "I received the Bose Open Earbuds a week ago after ordering from Amazon, delivery was quick and the next morning I was opening my new buds and preparing to put them through their paces, I own many other brands of earbuds from all over the world, even open earbuds from other brands.Unboxing was pretty straightforward. The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn\u2019t even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don\u2019t get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven\u2019t had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They\u2019re IPX4 rated, so I\u2019m not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I\u2019m surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn\u2019t shake them out. They\u2019re not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update. But I\u2019m happy with that, I have had enough run ins where I\u2019m listening to a book on my phone then start playing a game on my tablet and having to fight to make sure the sound is coming from the device I want it to come from.Overall these are great earbuds, flew right to the top of my list and are my favorite now. And I have the top of the line earbuds from several different manufacturers. The let me have music and stay connected to the world, something I have come to really appreciate.",

The only drawback (and it's a very small drawback) is the noise canceling is not quite as good as on my last pair of these. It's still acceptable though. For example, I have a soft top jeep and the ANC feature doesn't quite drown out the wind noise. To end the review these are an excellent product for the price point.",

Helps loud noise from being so rough on my ears but if it's really loud I will hear it pop in the buds. On quite mode is something even today I have a hard time adjusting to. It cuts out so much noise that when I take the buds out my ears, my brain has to adjust back to all the back ground noise again.Stability connections. Connecting Bluetooth when I first got the buds was easy but now is a whole new story. I have had one bud drop out of connection and the reconnect 3-5 minutes later. I have even had it were the buds was not insync with the sound.Comfort. I will say for myself I can wear the buds for a long period of time. The hardest part for me now is getting that tone in my ear to let me know it's a good fit in my ear. I have slept several times with them in my ears.App. This is where I think my biggest problem is with these buds. The app has a hand full of options and nothing impressive. You use the app to update the buds but the last update I believe gave me all my problems.So I say yes these are very good buds but nothing to go break the bank to get.",

In comparison to other open ear designs I have tried I would easily put these in the top 3. Bass response is good at most volumes. Clarity is very good and the imaging is surprisingly amazing. Vocal sound like they are in the center of my head. Very impressive for open ear design2) Volume is sufficient. These go loud enough to hear over traffic without any distortion and minimal loss of fidelity. Please keep in mind that there is a level of volume that is loud enough to negate the need for open ear at all. I mean, if it's blasting so loud that you can't hear sounds around you then maybe open ear is not the style for you3) comfort. These feel great. They are extremely light and even when they move around you don't even notice it. I have taken these on runs as long as 13 miles from easy days all the way up to advanced speed work and have had no issues with them shifting or falling off. They do not fit quite as tight as i had expected which seemed like it would be an issue, but surprisingly it was not a problem4) customization. This one is a mixed bag, but mostly good. The app gives you plenty of options to tweak the sound quality and customize the buttons. The only thing it won't let you do is change the single tap function. This isn't a deal breaker and i am guessing it has to do with a hard coded part of the firmware, but it would be nice to have a single tap function that is different on each head phone.So here are the things i think they could improve on:1) The buttons are a little mushy so they can be a little difficult to press and sometimes a little difficult if you are trying to double press or press and hold. I prefer a more \"clicky\" button that has some physical feedback when you press it. Or even if the buttons stuck out just a little bit more. When you are running fast and your hands are sweaty it can be a little bit of a challenge. Having said that, they are still way ahead of touch controls when you have sweaty hands2) no feedback on button presses. Most headphones have a simple \"beep\" when you press the button so you can tell that the headphones have received your input. This is useful when your devices take a second or two to respond. They beep when a bluetooth connection is made so I know the capability exists. This could be something they could add with a firmware/app update I am sure, and it would be nice to have3) no \"in field\" pairing. This set like many others, require the case to be present in order to pair them with your device. I have found a few that will let you pair them without the case and to me that is a HUGE benefit. It's not a deal breaker but that is something i would love to have and would even pay a few dollars more forBattery life so far has been about as expected which is roughly 20% per hour at 75% volume. Not \"Best in class\" but should be more than enough for most people to use for the dayOverall, i have tried a lot of different brands and models and they all have flaws and they all cost a lot more than these (sometimes upwards of twice the cost) and these have none of those flaws so far.I was hesitant to try a cheaper set from a brand i am not familiar with but i am glad that i did because these are my new daily use headphones when i run.",

        "review": "I'd used many models in the Samsung Galaxy Buds lineup, the last being a couple pairs of the Buds 2 Pros. While I liked the Samung earbuds, I put about 30 hours of use on the headphones weekly and they never held up for more than 3 or 4 months. One earbud (most always the right) would lose volume and quality until it failed to produce listenable sound at all. I'd use the Samung warranty, then the extended warranty that I'd purchased, then buy another pair and start over. Which each new model I'd hoped Samung had fixed the durability issues, but they never had, so I finally decided to try something new.In comes the Method 360s. I've been using these guys for nearly a year now and they haven't lost sound volume or quality in the slightest. While the higher frequencies might not be quite as clear or expansive as the Buds 2 Pros, I think they sound great for the price and I love their punchy bass. The volume on the highest setting also seems to be a little louder than other earbuds that I've had, which can be nice.I'm not impressed with their ANC. I hardly notice it compared to my Bose over-the-ear headphones, but it's not an issue when paired with their passive noise cancelation and I wasn't impressed with the Buds 2 Pros ANC, either. I have some connectivity issues here and there where one bud won't pair with my Samsung phone out of the case. I'll put the earbud back in the case and take it out again and then I'm good to go. I've never lost Bluetooth connection once paired.All in all, I think these are good buds for a good priceI finally decided to try something else and that's where these",

I\u2019ve been struggling to find a phone that is comfortable enough and don\u2019t fall of my ear during activities. This earphone sits very well on the ears and stay stuck until you want them loose. Definitely this thing is a masterpiece for the price and potential competitors.",

        "review": "So these are like Bose QC earbuds II same design and feel to them so if you ever seen or used them that's how it out of the case. The case is a bit weird it's a long case that slides up and down and each side is marked with R and L to tell which side each earbud goes to. The positives are the sound is amazing and anc is very good I use them at 40 to 50 percent volume and it blocks out a lot of sound. The charging is pretty fast about 20 minutes and I get an hour and some minutes back to listen to them again and these are very comfortable and come with 3 size options and are able it a good amount of colors to purchase and it has an option to connect to your email for fast connection to any device that uses that certain email which is cool. Another great thing is single earbud can use anc option which I use daily since my job only allows one earbud in and works great.Negatives are small in my opinion one is the battery life is a lie with anc on it lasts about 6.5 hours not 9 like it was registered on the list and I know because I usually work long shifts and about half way I have to charge up and second issue is with both earbuds in is stuttering this comes up at small intervals and it's annoying hearing skips in songs or video if you're in crowded place or on a walk and I think it has to do with Bluetooth connection not going through multiple channels and skull app is useless so I tried to fix by using their methods to attempt a fix and it still happens so I think it's a bad Bluetooth connection and I looked online and seen other people complaining about this issue.So in the end if skullcandy could fix the connection stutters and their own app to get this small issue to go away I would rate them 5 out 5 but it ain't it gots some issues like I mentioned above but it's like a good alternative to a cheaper version of the Bose QC earbuds II",

        "review": "Sounds quality is great, fitment is great, and connectivity for me was a breeze with no drops at all.I hit the gym with these 3 days in a row now with zero issues. The fitment is snug and no need for readjustment during my 1.5 hour gym sessions which also includes running the treadmill. The earbud silicone pieces do not get stuck in my ears or slide off the earbuds at all. I'm assuming people who complain about the silicone coming off/undone must be user error or improperly installed.Bluetooth connection for me has been solid on my Google Pixel 7 Pro, including my friends iPhone 16 Pro Max. I did download the Skullcandy IQ app which prompt me for an update that I did. No connectivity issues at all so far.My battery life is currently at 97% with 3 days worth of gym use at about 1.5hrs per day at medium to medium/high volume with ANC turned off (from fully charged).The case is on the bulky side, however, it's easy to use. People complaining about how difficult/annoying it is to put the earbuds back in the case are simple minded. All you have to do is literally look at the orientation of the ear buds upon removal and put them back the exact same way. I guess people need something to complain about.I'd absolutely recommend these earbuds, especially over the air pods, beats, or SoundCloud. Wait for a sale or buy them used like I did.",

These are some of the only headphones that fit my ears and don't fall out constantly. HOWEVER, their hardware quality is some of the worst I have ever seen. In the last two years I've had four pairs of Bose headphones and all of them have failed in some manner. Now the latest, after FOUR MONTHS, have failed too. Now the left headphone will only go up to abut 2/3 volume and past that only the right headphone increases in volume leaving the sound completely unbalanced and coming from the right ear. I've loved my Bose headphones prior to the last two years but I will NEVER buy another product from them again given the poor quality of their hardware that fails after a couple of months. Never again.",

The mids are also very present and vocals sound nice and detailed with these buds. I couldn\u2019t complain about their sound signature since it also comes with other presets that work very well.The fit is nice and snug since the design is made to fit the ear, with a slight protruding bump. Comes with 3 different eartips (one already on the buds).Controls are a better touch to them. They are touch control and can be customized. 3 taps and long press are present, so 4 different control types are there.ANC and transparency are a bang for your buck. ANC is up there for the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s and their transparency is also good enough to still stay aware of your surroundings. It\u2019s not the clearest but definitely great.Their case and earbuds themselves feel premium and worth their price.

I was very disappointed to find out that there wasn\u2019t a bass boost like most other Baseus products have.

The Dolby Audio isn\u2019t the best and custom EQ doesn\u2019t provide the same experience as it does compared to the other standard EQ presents we can choose from.

        "review": "These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a \"beep\" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.",

        "review": "I work in a dental lab and I have bad noise sensitivity issues. Bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other ear buds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did and good lord the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block SO MUCH. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and the cool little bands they have around the bud keeps them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh NOTHING. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (android). They are VERY sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip or go back.Music and audio books sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had including Sony's has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace.On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it and twice it stopped syncing.  I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud so if I was taking the left one out first ( I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right on out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the, battery at blah blah percent prompt then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in and I have never had another problem and I waited a over solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life altering product that has made an ENORMOUS difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of NOISE.On battery life. At work I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me.  I am there for 9 hours.In my opinion these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out.",

        "review": "These are good! I am coming from some older earbuds, namely the original pixel buds pro earbuds. I felt that those earbuds hit a better price point than their successors, the pixel buds pro 2, did. They recently started to give me some trouble and the battery has been degrading quite rapidly, so I know I needed to look for a new set. These Bose buds caught my eye as the largest limitation with the OG pixel buds was their ANC performance. I use earbuds a lot when performing yard work, so drowning out various tools and traffic noise were top of my priorities. Additionally, I did not want to spend 200+ USD on something like the AZ100 or the more premium offers from Sony/Bose.These have filled those requirements nearly perfectly. I am very impressed with ANC performance, they seem very similar to my Sony WH-XM3s. This is a very impressive feat for in ear buds, but I know that the Sonys are a few generations old at this stage. I can say that they handily outperform the pixel buds. This seems especially true with higher frequency sounds. Overall, very impressed with how they handle noise suppression/ANC in busy environments as well. Voices seem to be suppressed quite well.I was also presently suprised by sounds quality. I think that these sound a little better than the OG pixel buds do. Clarity is better, especially in the mids. These also tend to get really loud, especially compared to the pixel buds. I notice I am often not using more than 50% of the volume available to achieve normal listening volumes. Bass is somewhat bloated, overall similar to the Sony WH-XM3s, but this is overall a pleasurable tune and can be adjusted with a 5 band equalizer.There are some potential downsides. While the buds themselves feel high quality, the case feels relatively cheap and oversized. The OG pixelbuds have been rock solid for me. Their case has survived numerous drops and being mistaken for a dog toy a time or two. The Bose QC case feels much lighter and the cover feels much thinner. The hinge also does not feel nearly as robust. With that said, I do appreciate that they sell a replacement charging case for 60$.  While it was touched on, I do also want to mention that the case seems just a little too large. It's about 50% thicker than the pixel buds or airpods. It's still very pocketable, but I do not think I will carry them with me at all times like I did with the pixel buds. The intrusiveness of the larger case in conjunction with my concerns about durability make me hesitant.Overall, these are really nice earbuds. I have not experienced any connectivity issues using the latest update. They connect and play quickly as expected. They have had great stability in ear, even while running. I think these strike a very good value for money where spending more may have diminishing returns. I think this is especially relevant as it seems that all wireless earbuds tend to have a lifespan of a few years before they are end of life due to wear or battery degradation. It's hard for me to justify spending more on something I can only expect to last 2-4 years.",

        "review": "These ear buds have some incredible noise cancellation! I usually use them when studying in noisy places like the dinning hall to help me focus better and to help protect my ears.I've used them on multiple devices mainly being my phone and my laptop for school so they seem to be as compatible as you would expect from a pair of earbuds.You can connect them to up to 2 devices, you can't have audio from both at the same time though.I really like the additional rubber ring that they have as part of the earbud instead of just having the rubber tip, it makes it stay in your ear far better. They include 3 different sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ear.I would definitely recommend these for any college students that would like durable earbuds with strong noise cancellation and good sound quality for a reasonable price for a pair of ear buds!",

        "review": "First, I want to say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2024  are easily the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever had. The sound is great (not a audiophile here, so strictly an objective opinion) And the noise cancellation is, far and away, better than expected. All this is why I\u2019ve tried everything to work through a major design flaw.All the reviews praise these buds, only mentioning (almost as an aside) that there are connection issues. Also, many purchaser reviews play down this problem \u2013 only commenting about one side or the other temporarily losing connection (an occasional glitch with many brands)What they\u2019re missing is that all of these reviews seem to be using the buds while engaged in some activity (eg: gym, running, walking, etc). When sedentary (ie: motionless, lying down or reclining) the Bose Buds will consistently lose their connection. I\u2019ve even tried to disable in-ear detection (the option to do so not offered by Bose). Using tape over the in-ear sensor, I\u2019ve found that the buds still seem to require some motion to \u201cstay alive\u201d.I am currently awaiting delivery of my 3rd replacement earbuds and am really hoping that at some point Bose will try to do something about this in a future firmware update.-- Update --The following (in brackets) I submitted to Bose today to try to solve the issue I was having<< I am now on my 4th pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (gen 2) 2024. This latest replacement has proven to be the best functioning so far. The primary problem, however, still persists.In doing some testing I believe a possible a clue to the cause of my most nagging issue has shown up. My primary use of the earbuds is for meditation (ie: while wearing them my head is almost entirely motionless). It appears that the buds are designed to detect movement and that a lack of motion causes one or both of the buds disconnect periodically.Testing this hypothesis during a few listening sessions, I made a point of moving my head every 10 minutes. By doing so, I was able to listen without interruption through several tests (one of then for an hour & 45 minutes). Of course, having to concentrate on moving my head is no acceptable solution. >>- - After reviewing my query, I was informed that this is, indeed part of their design and nothing can be done. The fact that it\u2019s a problem that many have mentioned in You-tube reviews and online comments was not addressed. My conclusion is that Bose is now a company trading on its past reputation and should be avoided. Thus - for obvious reasons - I've reduced my rating to 1 star (zero is not an option here)",

        "review": "I've used many, many different pairs of earbuds. Most with active noise cancellation, and I can honestly say these are the best by a mile! I used them in a variaty of enviroments from a noisy office space, on a plan, and at home with the constant noise of my kids and their toys. Every time you put them in your ears, you're presented with a symponic sound that tunes the earbuds and checks the seal to your ear. It helps make the noise canceling feature work the best I've ever heard! I have a white noise machine that helps my wife sleep at night, and these buds can block out that sound 100% on its loudest setting! That way, when she's trying to sleep, I can watch some streaming content without the sound of anything in the background, making it easy to hear the smallest sound in what you're watching, like someone breathing in a quiet, tense moment, even when there's a bunch of noise all around you. The Bose app is great too! it makes it easy to customize the use of the earbuds, manage the devices they are connected to, and adjust the EQ and noise cancellation feature. The spartial audio feature makes it seem like you are listening in a large concert hall vs. a set of earbuds. You must try it when you get your pair! You can find it in the \"immersion\" menu in the Bose app on your phone. The earbuds fit very securely in your ear. There are enough fit pieces in the box to fit almost any ear shape. I love that the V2 has so many colors to choose from. I went with the black/gold version, and I love the way they look! overall, I give these a 5/5! well worh the money!",

So I needed an earbuds that aside from comfort I'm able to use all capabilities. I've had other Bose products and I was fairly confident that Bose wouldn't let me down. I'm happy to say that yay, I got my money's worth! The sound quality was impressive and the sample audio clip that Bose had during the setup phase really showed that off. I like that it had all these different features in there, Still Immersion, etc. So of course, I listed to my own songs and it was great. Noise cancelling was superb in my honest opinion. I heard the difference when it is on and off. I didn't hear my Mom when she was talking with the earbuds on and I'm like duh! i have the earbuds on lol. This was without any sound on so my Mom's voice was so distant and far away. I also tested the Bose with my work laptop as I conduct video meetings and again I'm very happy with it. My coworkers did not complain that they couldn't hear me so it looks like the mic placement in the Bose is great. I'm happy to no longer use my big headphones with the sticking out microphone. By the way, the Bose was Bluetooth connected to my two devices, my Android Phone and work laptop and there was no issue to start using the work laptop for the video meetings so that was very convenient. In regard to fit, I did not change the pads. It looks like medium is my size, and so far, I have not experienced any pain in my ear from wearing it too long. I've had it on for about an hour. I will have to continue to observe if I experience any pain if I wear it for more than an hour. The case itself is pretty portable, in my opinion, and it is not slippery \u2014 which I love because I don\u2019t feel the need to purchase a case cover. This uses a USB-C and has wireless charging, and both so far have worked flawlessly. In conclusion, I totally recommend these Bose earbuds. I am using it for both work and personal reasons and so Im definitely getting the bang out of my buck.",

In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",

        "review": "I received the Bose Open Earbuds a week ago after ordering from Amazon, delivery was quick and the next morning I was opening my new buds and preparing to put them through their paces, I own many other brands of earbuds from all over the world, even open earbuds from other brands.Unboxing was pretty straightforward. The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn\u2019t even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don\u2019t get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven\u2019t had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They\u2019re IPX4 rated, so I\u2019m not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I\u2019m surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn\u2019t shake them out. They\u2019re not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update. But I\u2019m happy with that, I have had enough run ins where I\u2019m listening to a book on my phone then start playing a game on my tablet and having to fight to make sure the sound is coming from the device I want it to come from.Overall these are great earbuds, flew right to the top of my list and are my favorite now. And I have the top of the line earbuds from several different manufacturers. The let me have music and stay connected to the world, something I have come to really appreciate.",

        "review": "I received the Bose Open Earbuds a week ago after ordering from Amazon, delivery was quick and the next morning I was opening my new buds and preparing to put them through their paces, I own many other brands of earbuds from all over the world, even open earbuds from other brands.Unboxing was pretty straightforward. The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn\u2019t even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don\u2019t get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven\u2019t had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They\u2019re IPX4 rated, so I\u2019m not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I\u2019m surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn\u2019t shake them out. They\u2019re not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update. But I\u2019m happy with that, I have had enough run ins where I\u2019m listening to a book on my phone then start playing a game on my tablet and having to fight to make sure the sound is coming from the device I want it to come from.Overall these are great earbuds, flew right to the top of my list and are my favorite now. And I have the top of the line earbuds from several different manufacturers. The let me have music and stay connected to the world, something I have come to really appreciate.",

The only drawback (and it's a very small drawback) is the noise canceling is not quite as good as on my last pair of these. It's still acceptable though. For example, I have a soft top jeep and the ANC feature doesn't quite drown out the wind noise. To end the review these are an excellent product for the price point.",

        "review": "Usually I say they are good for what it\u2019s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro\u2019s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won\u2019t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can\u2019t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I\u2019m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I\u2019m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.

Technically 5 because semi-last shipment mysteriously was a children's $5 item rather than my headphones.- Requires Bose app which is NOT privacy-friendly per my analysis of the app's internet connection data.- Has ongoing microphone issues: bad quality/static during many calls. Well known to Bose for years. No fixes available.- This 5th pair is \"Josh's headphones\". Tells me everything I suspected about Amazon's refurbishing quality. At least there's no earwax, so... 2 stars I guess.Pros: best ANC, period. Silences even people's voices and actually negates common sounds in the real world, unlike my experience with Google Buds Pro 2. ANC is even better than the Sony WF-1000XM5, which are even more expensive.Moral of the story: wifi headphones are a mess.

Came across these Bose earbuds, and did some deep research on them.  I really did not especially want to pay this much for a new set of earbuds, but I have always been impressed with any Bose product I have used in the past.  Found the \"renewed\" buds, so decided to give it a try.  Here are some things to know ... these are the best earbuds I have ever used.  Period.  Extremely comfortable.  And the overall sound is unlike anything I have used in the past.  It is deep, rich sound.  Great bass.  And the \"immersion\" setting puts you right in the middle of the band.

So they are a little bulky (i have small ears, but they fit me pretty good) and they are suprisingly quite comfortable, thankfully it comes with different size eartips so adjustment is there.ANC is on these is actually crazy i can't hear a thing when it's on i've tried other earbuds these are fantastic, Aware mode is really good too no complaints. The audio quality is extremely good the app comes with an eq so that's good (app is slow tho haha)  the modes are insane too except immersive i personally didn't like it on these earbuds, i don't know if it's a new feature on these earphones but to me it ain't it. Refurbished is the way to go cuz 300$ is wild. Overall best earbuds i've ever had",

I couldn't be more wrong. Bass Boost ? None .. Tinty sound and I spent hrs trying you adjust.  Noise canceling? I use my earbuds mosting for cycling as I ride 2hrs on the road. I could not even tell what song was playing . Very disappointed with this product.  I bought a set of Bose for 100 dollars 6 years ago and this Ultra set really lowered the bar when to wanting great sound.... Im returning for refund and No Stars !!!",

        "review": "- Amazon-renewed version fails often: 4 pairs in less than 6 months. Technically 5 because semi-last shipment mysteriously was a children's $5 item rather than my headphones.- Requires Bose app which is NOT privacy-friendly per my analysis of the app's internet connection data.- Has ongoing microphone issues: bad quality/static during many calls. Well known to Bose for years. No fixes available.- This 5th pair is \"Josh's headphones\". Tells me everything I suspected about Amazon's refurbishing quality. At least there's no earwax, so... 2 stars I guess.Pros: best ANC, period. Silences even people's voices and actually negates common sounds in the real world, unlike my experience with Google Buds Pro 2. ANC is even better than the Sony WF-1000XM5, which are even more expensive.Moral of the story: wifi headphones are a mess. Refurbished Bose is hit and miss.... and miss.... and miss....ad infinitum.",

        "review": "I'd used many models in the Samsung Galaxy Buds lineup, the last being a couple pairs of the Buds 2 Pros. While I liked the Samung earbuds, I put about 30 hours of use on the headphones weekly and they never held up for more than 3 or 4 months. One earbud (most always the right) would lose volume and quality until it failed to produce listenable sound at all. I'd use the Samung warranty, then the extended warranty that I'd purchased, then buy another pair and start over. Which each new model I'd hoped Samung had fixed the durability issues, but they never had, so I finally decided to try something new.In comes the Method 360s. I've been using these guys for nearly a year now and they haven't lost sound volume or quality in the slightest. While the higher frequencies might not be quite as clear or expansive as the Buds 2 Pros, I think they sound great for the price and I love their punchy bass. The volume on the highest setting also seems to be a little louder than other earbuds that I've had, which can be nice.I'm not impressed with their ANC. I hardly notice it compared to my Bose over-the-ear headphones, but it's not an issue when paired with their passive noise cancelation and I wasn't impressed with the Buds 2 Pros ANC, either. I have some connectivity issues here and there where one bud won't pair with my Samsung phone out of the case. I'll put the earbud back in the case and take it out again and then I'm good to go. I've never lost Bluetooth connection once paired.All in all, I think these are good buds for a good priceI finally decided to try something else and that's where these",

        "review": "So these are like Bose QC earbuds II same design and feel to them so if you ever seen or used them that's how it out of the case. The case is a bit weird it's a long case that slides up and down and each side is marked with R and L to tell which side each earbud goes to. The positives are the sound is amazing and anc is very good I use them at 40 to 50 percent volume and it blocks out a lot of sound. The charging is pretty fast about 20 minutes and I get an hour and some minutes back to listen to them again and these are very comfortable and come with 3 size options and are able it a good amount of colors to purchase and it has an option to connect to your email for fast connection to any device that uses that certain email which is cool. Another great thing is single earbud can use anc option which I use daily since my job only allows one earbud in and works great.Negatives are small in my opinion one is the battery life is a lie with anc on it lasts about 6.5 hours not 9 like it was registered on the list and I know because I usually work long shifts and about half way I have to charge up and second issue is with both earbuds in is stuttering this comes up at small intervals and it's annoying hearing skips in songs or video if you're in crowded place or on a walk and I think it has to do with Bluetooth connection not going through multiple channels and skull app is useless so I tried to fix by using their methods to attempt a fix and it still happens so I think it's a bad Bluetooth connection and I looked online and seen other people complaining about this issue.So in the end if skullcandy could fix the connection stutters and their own app to get this small issue to go away I would rate them 5 out 5 but it ain't it gots some issues like I mentioned above but it's like a good alternative to a cheaper version of the Bose QC earbuds II",

        "review": "Sounds quality is great, fitment is great, and connectivity for me was a breeze with no drops at all.I hit the gym with these 3 days in a row now with zero issues. The fitment is snug and no need for readjustment during my 1.5 hour gym sessions which also includes running the treadmill. The earbud silicone pieces do not get stuck in my ears or slide off the earbuds at all. I'm assuming people who complain about the silicone coming off/undone must be user error or improperly installed.Bluetooth connection for me has been solid on my Google Pixel 7 Pro, including my friends iPhone 16 Pro Max. I did download the Skullcandy IQ app which prompt me for an update that I did. No connectivity issues at all so far.My battery life is currently at 97% with 3 days worth of gym use at about 1.5hrs per day at medium to medium/high volume with ANC turned off (from fully charged).The case is on the bulky side, however, it's easy to use. People complaining about how difficult/annoying it is to put the earbuds back in the case are simple minded. All you have to do is literally look at the orientation of the ear buds upon removal and put them back the exact same way. I guess people need something to complain about.I'd absolutely recommend these earbuds, especially over the air pods, beats, or SoundCloud. Wait for a sale or buy them used like I did.",

I tried 4 more pairs, 2 directly from bose, and they all had the same issue across different devices & OS's. I also had constant connectivity issues.If you use earbuds for the ANC, skip these. They are basically unusable. (I suggest going back a generation for noise cancellation, if you can.)",
