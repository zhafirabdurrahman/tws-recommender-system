The only ones that worked for me in the past were the Bose SoundSport. After that, I used Beats Pro over-ear headphones. While they stayed on, I was never truly impressed with the sound quality.I spent weeks researching before purchasing these, and I\u2019m so glad I did. They fit comfortably in my small ears and stay put without any issues. The active noise cancellation is excellent\u2014at the gym, I used to hear conversations and background noise through my old headphones, but with these properly seated, I hear NOTHING at all!The sound quality and clarity are a noticeable upgrade from my old Beats, and I really like being able to adjust the sound through the app. I prefer bass-heavy music, and these deliver. While volume controls on the earbuds themselves would be nice, it\u2019s not a deal breaker since my phone is usually nearby.If you struggle with earbuds staying in your ears and want a high-quality pair of headphones that cost about half the price of other major brands\u2014while performing even better in my opinion\u2014I highly recommend giving these a try!",

        "review": "These are great sounding earbuds and they are fantastic for the price. You really can't get any better. I specifically needed these though because I need a good transparency mode and I didn't want to spend too much for earbuds. I have nicer earbuds that have much better noise canceling but The trade-off with the other earbuds that I have tried was that they had a poor transparency mode so it seems like at this price you kind of get one of the other. The noise canceling isn't terrible on these earbuds it's just that if that is what you want more than anything you can get better on different earbuds. So again if you're looking for a good all-around earbud with great transparency mode go with these. I should also note I have smaller ears and although they are a little bit bulky they fit and they do not fall out. A little tip though, twist them a little bit to get them to grab onto your ear just right.",

        "review": "These Galaxy buds fe are almost perfect.As an audiophile these definitely sound great, a bit of treble sparkle, slightly boosted mids and BASS. While I personally think they sound better than the Method 360 ANC by Skullcandy, they have quite a ways to go to become the perfect earbud.The battery life is not the greatest as I only get 5-6 hours with ANC on. And about 22-24 with the case.The fit is very good, I'm glad to see a stability fin on these. Not only does it make them fit better, but man do the look good. Also speaking of the fin, they do stay in the ear very well, and with their IPX2 rating I've had them drenched in sweat and snow and everything still works so prompts to Samsung.The ANC is good enough as it reduces background noise and softens conversations around.The app experience is very cool, one thing is I downloaded the Wearable app and was told that the app was not needed and that I could access everything from the settings app on my S23. Don't know if it was a UI update or something, but all very cool.Two things. One, the ANC stays off until you go into the settings and change it yourself, so you can have ANC in just one  earbud.Two, the wear detection works but it takes the earbuds a second to realize its not in my ear. Also just a general note I'd like to have a company who makes an earbud with wear detection and it just pauses the earbud you took out and not both earbuds.Overall they are very good earbuds and will be great for a casual listener who wants a Samsung product. These are great!!!",

So bit  bullet and bought these and I'm glad I did. They were easy to connect. They charge great. They fit in the ear perfectly and come with sized earbuds and a few other attachments from outside the ear when the earbuds are in  to adjust for comfort. wasn't too deep in Pocket (if you choose to do a monthly payment plan like I did) comes in into simple yet pretty good looking colors. I must say black and white. I chose white so I can find them even in their case in the case itself fits in the palm of the hand very comfortably and I omit I am bad with taking the earbuds out of the case and sometimes holding the case itself, but in having had these for a bit. I did fumble the case and it didn't fly open which is a blessing The functions in the earbuds themselves are very simple, personally I have absolutely no care that they don't do volume control for me. It's starting stopping and just moving on to the next song and answering calls. They are very excellent for that. They work great. Oh, and let's not forget the sound quality and noise cancellation. It doesn't drown out the environment around you, but it gives a perfect balance of quiet and self-awareness where you can enjoy what you're listening to and not be completely unaware of what's going on around you.",

        "review": "Actually worth the price. The pinch function works great, the ANC is great, the volume is spectacular, and they fit in my ear for my 6 mile run today and didn't fall out even remotely (despite that i sweat a lot). The case is compact and everything is very well built, although the case feels a bit \"plastic-y\". Just be cautious with that. They are pretty comfortable as well, the M size nibs fit for me. The connectivity is of course very quick and took me less than a minute to set it up right. No fooling around with EQs necessarry either- for most. They sound fantastic out the box. If you're a bit of an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate the experience for all genres. I suspect if you like a lot of hip hop/rap/pop/electronic music you may want to hike up the bass and scoop the mids a bit. And for rock/metal/country/jazz/classical these will sound great as is but i lowered the 4k a bit and boosted the 63 and 125 to give it a slight bump in bass still for personal preference. Highly recommend overall, especially if you have a Samsung as it fits well into the ecosystem. No comment on battery life as this is just 1 good day of use,  but I'm assuming it will work for my purposes and just need to charge up daily/every other day (if that? Maybe better?) which is okay either way.",

The soundstage is wider and the call clarity is the best I\u2019ve experienced on a pair of stems.The Pros:The Fit: They feel more secure than the previous 'bean' or 'bud' shapes. I can wear them for hours without ear fatigue.ANC Performance: The Active Noise Canceling is top-tier. It easily drowns out low-frequency hums like plane engines or office chatter.Sound Quality: Crisp highs and a punchy bass that doesn't feel muddy.The One Con: If you like to sing along to your music, turn off the Voice Detect/Adaptive mode. The AI is so sensitive that it thinks I\u2019m trying to start a conversation whenever I sing a lyric, and it immediately lowers the music volume. It\u2019s a great feature for an office, but a total buzzkill for solo jam sessions.Verdict: Incredible hardware. Just be prepared to dive into the Wearable app settings to customize the AI features to your liking.",

The pinch function works great, the ANC is great, the volume is spectacular, and they fit in my ear for my 6 mile run today and didn't fall out even remotely (despite that i sweat a lot). The case is compact and everything is very well built, although the case feels a bit \"plastic-y\". Just be cautious with that. They are pretty comfortable as well, the M size nibs fit for me. The connectivity is of course very quick and took me less than a minute to set it up right. No fooling around with EQs necessarry either- for most. They sound fantastic out the box. If you're a bit of an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate the experience for all genres. I suspect if you like a lot of hip hop/rap/pop/electronic music you may want to hike up the bass and scoop the mids a bit. And for rock/metal/country/jazz/classical these will sound great as is but i lowered the 4k a bit and boosted the 63 and 125 to give it a slight bump in bass still for personal preference. Highly recommend overall, especially if you have a Samsung as it fits well into the ecosystem. No comment on battery life as this is just 1 good day of use,  but I'm assuming it will work for my purposes and just need to charge up daily/every other day (if that?

        "review": "These work great. The sound quality is great & I love the noise canceling feature. Though you do need the Samsung Wear app to control them - activate / deactivate the noise canceling feature. Since I keep my phone's Bluetooth turned off, I love the feature where after you take the buds out of their case and put them in your ear, you get a message on your phone asking if you want to connect them. I don't have to manually turn on the Bluetooth. The only drawback it seems is that I can't really use them with my Samsung TV. Although they connect and I can hear the sound, after a bit the sound starts to make digital distortions. But, no such issues when connected to the phone. The battery life is great and lasts up to ~6 hours on the buds. The case can charge the buds a few times before it itself requires charging. The Wear app shows the percentage of charge remaining for both the buds as well as the case. And unlike some other types of buds, these are essy to take out of the case.",

Awesome bass and great highs and mids (the mids could be marginally better as opposed to Pro's 2 and 3) but not enough to justify 3x the price of these. Really nice that you can turn off ANC and check both earbud and cae charge level through your phone. My favorite part of these buds is that you don't have to have Bluetooth on to recognize they are near, your phone will automatically ask if you'd like to pair when opening the case, and switches Bluetooth on for you!",

        "review": "I bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE), and let me just say, these are NOT your average earbuds. These are the superhero of sound, the Beyonc\u00e9 of Bluetooth, the James Bond of noise-canceling\u2014basically, they\u2019re everything I never knew I needed in my life, and now I can\u2019t live without them.The Pros:Active Noise-Canceling? More Like Active Life-Changing \u2013 I thought noise-canceling was just a \u201ccool feature,\u201d but NO. These babies don\u2019t just block out the noise, they block out your ENTIRE LIFE. Kids yelling? Gone. Your neighbor\u2019s dog barking at 3 AM? Not even a whisper. The sound of your own thoughts? Who needs them? These buds don\u2019t let anything in\u2026 except for your favorite jams.Earbuds that Fit Like They\u2019re Meant to Be \u2013 If you\u2019ve ever bought earbuds that feel like they\u2019re trying to escape your ears mid-jog, then you know the struggle. These? Fit like a glove (except for your ears, obviously, but you get the point). No slipping, no adjusting, no awkwardly trying to pop them back in when you\u2019re about to give a TED Talk on the importance of \u201cListening to Your Favorite Playlist\u201d (seriously, these fit that snug).Sound Quality That Makes You Feel Like You\u2019re in a Concert Hall \u2013 Every note is crisp, every beat is beyond satisfying, and I swear I could hear the microwave beep in a whole new way. These Galaxy Buds make your favorite music sound like it was made in a recording studio with actual magic. If you want to feel like a rockstar while doing your laundry, these are the buds for you.Touch Controls Are So Futuristic, I Feel Like I\u2019m In a Sci-Fi Movie \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I needed touch controls until I had them. Want to change the song? Just tap the side. Volume too loud? Swipe down like you're controlling the volume of your future robot overlords. I can practically feel my IQ going up with every tap.Battery Life That Lasts Longer Than My Attention Span \u2013 I\u2019ve used these buds for hours and hours, and they still had juice left. It\u2019s like they run on pure, unadulterated energy. I\u2019ve forgotten to charge them overnight and still had a full day of listening ahead of me. The only thing they can\u2019t do is remind me to charge my phone\u2026 but that\u2019s probably coming in the next edition.The Cons:I Might Become a Music Snob \u2013 I never realized how bad my old earbuds were until I put these in. Now, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, this song was supposed to sound like that?\u201d It\u2019s like hearing your favorite song for the first time all over again. Prepare to get snobby about sound quality and turn your nose up at anything less than \u201cactive noise-canceling perfection.\u201dOnce You Put Them In, You Might Never Leave Your House \u2013 Seriously, I put these in while cleaning, and suddenly, I was two hours deep into a podcast and forgot I had even started the dishes. These buds make doing mundane tasks feel like you're in a high-budget music video. Be careful\u2014you might forget how to exist in the real world.Conclusion:The SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE) have elevated my audio game in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible. They cancel noise, they amplify sound, and they make me feel like I could conquer the world (or at least my to-do list) while jamming out to my favorite tunes.If you want earbuds that make you feel like a VIP at a private concert, buy these. If you want to block out your neighbor\u2019s questionable karaoke sessions, buy these. And if you just want to listen to your Spotify playlist like it was meant to be heard\u2014you guessed it\u2014buy these.TL;DR: These are the best earbuds I\u2019ve ever had, and I now believe they might be secretly part of a government experiment to make us all smarter, more productive, and significantly cooler. Highly recommend.",

If you're a bit of an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate the experience for all genres. I suspect if you like a lot of hip hop/rap/pop/electronic music you may want to hike up the bass and scoop the mids a bit. And for rock/metal/country/jazz/classical these will sound great as is but i lowered the 4k a bit and boosted the 63 and 125 to give it a slight bump in bass still for personal preference. Highly recommend overall, especially if you have a Samsung as it fits well into the ecosystem. No comment on battery life as this is just 1 good day of use,  but I'm assuming it will work for my purposes and just need to charge up daily/every other day (if that?

        "review": "About 5 years ago Samsung released the legendary Galaxy Buds Live in August of 2020I was fortunate enough to be able to receive buds live with an s22 ultra from Samsung in 2021, those buds have been my daily driver's since thenWe are talking all day long from work, to the ride home and throughout my night and even through sleep on some occasionsFinding a replacement for the buds live is challenging, I was not lucky enough to grab a new pair at retail before they were discontinued and my old buds have various issues between charging to audio quality but now is the time they get replacedThe new buds 3 were a somewhat confusing decision only due to Amazon having a separate more expensive version with a two year warranty and some issue with shipping but whateverAfter my first use I am very blown away, I have only turned them up to about 1/3 the max volume but they are noticeably louder than my buds live which have to be turned up until two notches past the volume warning to hear under certain circumstancesThe fit in the ear is much better due to the larger design and the speaker hole is also bigger so the sound isn't so cannedThe price was ok about 100 but I can't speak for the battery life or anything else yetIf there was one thing I don't like it's the stem controls but in comparison to the buds live with a touch sensor on the exterior that always didn't function correctly... Even with touches blocked it would still hang up calls so I had to use good lock to make a custom event where if I double tap the power button it enabled touches blocked but I had to do this Everytime I switch earphones or if I go from a video to answering a call it would re enable touchesI paired my buds with a locking case from Spigen. Not happy that you have to glue the top on but Spigen gives you a spare adhesive strip and so far it doesn't seem like it will come apart easily",

        "review": "TLDR; These are great, even at MSRP. I wish I bought these when they came out. Sale prices make these a no brainer, especially for those that don't want rubber tips in their ears. Battery life is decent and all play/pause and volume swipe functions work in Windows 11 without the app installed.This will include comparisons to AirPods 4 ANC:I've been using AirPods 4 on my PC for a while and they've worked fine.  My personal gripe is that the stem doesn't have the volume swipe gestures like the AirPods Pro 2/3.  Maybe Apple will add this for AirPods 5 in the future, but guess what these have now. That's right, I can now adjust volume as well.Fitment will depend of the person, like most earbuds, but these feel just slightly larger in general so in my case, they fit fine.Sound quality seems fine.  I'm no audiophile but these sound good with a hint more bass than the Airpods but I believe this can be adjusted.Wireless charging works like it should and I've got some Ringke cases on the way to get them to latch on to magsage chargers.Note, there is software for Windows 11 already and it looks basic but it seemingly gives you a better idea of the buds battery life instead of the built in Windows bluetooth page staying at 100% until you reconnect them to reflect the actual battery life. And speaking of, battery life is good.  Granted these are brand new but they seemingly went the full 5-6 hours when switching noise cancelling on and off.I initially thought these had a transparency mode but looks like these simply don't.  So the Airpods 4 ANC get a slight edge, but I'm taking the volume control over that.  I would love for these to come out in a variety of colors, not just because options would be nice, but since I've got two pairs, the different colors would make it much more obvious which pair goes where. That's another thing the Ringke cases will help with.Well done Samsung.",

It does work with older models such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. The case fells so nice but can easily get scratched if left in pocket with car keys and other hard objects. Battery life is not bad at all, as both buds can last 2+ hours or more, even if you you use it longer and the battery dies out, it charges super quickly. The case should charge the earbuds 3 around full battery cycles, more or less. I've read reviews  about the bad comfort from the Buds 3 so I chose this one, refurbished. Good as new!",

I love to stick with things and i love comfort and i don't like the unpredictability of new things.My Samsung Buds2 tip got spoiled plus it's no longer as loud, while working out last week, the left side of my Buds+ went out. I did everything i could and even called Samsung to no avail. I have small ears and so i really loved my previous buds. I was really apprehensive towards these ones being that they don't look as compact as the last ones I own. When i got them, they did not have the original box, so i was even more apprehensive and thought to myself I will surely be returning this. BUT, upon opening it, it was clean and no visible damage or anything.So far, the sound quality blew my mind immediately i put it on, I got chills. Also, upon taking a picture of it on my S24+ to leave this review, it automatically gave me option to pair(interesting). I hadn't had it on for long before the battery ran out but i can't comment on this because i do not know if it was fully charge(update later on this).The fit is also something I'll have to get used to as my ears are small(I loved the fit of the Buds+ better). It also has some settings that are not available on the other sets i have such as-\"Voice Detect\"(reduces volume if it detects your voice incase you are having a conversation while listening so you don't have to take them off)-\"Head tracking\"(adjusts volume according to how you turn your head)-Neck Stretch reminders(incase you bend your head too much looking at your screen).Now i waiting a few days to post this review( 03/02/25). I'd have to say although i really love the sound quality, but i have to constantly adjust it in my ears alot more than i did my last two especially when i go jogging/running. Literally every few seconds. Annoying...but I don't think I'll return it because i don't have a better audio option for the price point at this time. Also, it doesn't have the volume touch controls like the previous ones.07/06/25: Update.This is a long overdue update. Now i get why it was on refurbished sale. The earbuds are horrible for calls which are very important for me. No one can here me on the phone if i use them which is pretty annoying since it was one of the most important reasons i bought them.",

        "review": "I had a Buds Pro I got a few years ago, and then I guess they fell out of my pocket while I was out because they're gone. So I got these.Fit feels a little better than the Pros did, but I'm probably imagining that. Connects to the wear app easily and well, allowing control such as changing from surround sound to ambient sounds. Love that you can turn off touch controls. My ears are garbage at holding buds in so I constantly have to push them back in. (It's not an incorrectly sized ear-tip. Large is way too big, medium doesn't get a perfect grip. Broken ears.)I will admit I haven't tried the call option, as I seldom get calls, and haven't at all while wearing them. I do know the original Pros worked great though.

        "review": "These buds are a big let-down, especially since they are priced and positioned to be the top buds Samsung makes. I'm into personal tech, and I own way too many Apple and Samsung devices. I currently use a Samsung Galaxy Fold 7, and that is the phone I've been using with these buds. I also currently own the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and I also have Apple Earpods Pro as well (also used the Samsung buds with Ipad Pros and Window laptops)Unfortunately, from a reliability stand point, the Apple Earpods Pro work better with my Samsung phone than Samsung's own ear buds.Issues:1. My right ear bud just stopped charging and connecting. I've charged, pulled the bud in and out of the case, pushed it in, re-paired, reset, and I cannot get the right ear bud to charge or connect. Just period, right now, after days of messing with it, the right ear bud doesn't work. I've had these buds for like 3 months.2. Pairing doesn't always activate. Generally, to pair, you open the case and hold the pair button for a few seconds, and it's supposed to enter pairing mode. Unfortunately, with these buds, that process has not worked on several occasions. I noticed this issue seems to happen more often when the buds connect to a previously paired device, and then you try to pair to a new device. Probably a software bug, but common, these are the Pros, and should not have these issues. For comparison, I've never had a pairing issue with my Airpods Pros, Apple or Android device.3. Mic/voice dropouts. On several occasions, when answering a phone call, or doing a Teams call, the audio would work, but the mic would not. The bluetooth settings would say everything is connected (both audio and mic), but for whatever reason, the mic-audio would not work. Probably another software setting, but it happened to me on a couple important work-related calls, and it's one of those things that really makes you lose confidence in the buds. I've had this happen once with the Airpods Pros, but only once.Good things:1. As a techy person, I really liked the LED lights on the blade portion of the buds.2. When it works, big caveat, when it works, the integrated world of Samsung devices is nice (e.g. auto-switch between devices, battery levels, customization, etc).3. I like the look of the case and buds better than the Apply buds.Would I buy again? No. If you're debating between the Samsung buds Pro and the Apply buds Pro, even if you're an Android user, I would recommend going with the Apple Buds Pro.",

        "review": "I have tried a handful of Bluetooth ear buds and have used airpods pro 2 as my daily drivers for the past 2yrs. These sound better and from what I can tell the mics do a better job at noise isolation. There are things that samsung really should change on the next iteration of these. The way they seat into the case could have been better, the angle they sit at I have to turn the ear buds 180 degrees to put them in my ear when pulling them from the case. The triangular shaped stems make it so you have to put them back into the case a certain angle and requires more effort from the user versus with a rounded stem you just get the stem partialy in the case and then the built in magnets helping get them orientated and seated correctly. When adjusting them in my ears, I almost every time hit the haptic button built into the stems that pauses the music. They should have put more thought into the colors. I intentionally didn't go with the white because I didn't want them to look like my previous airpods but the silver color with the blue and red tabs on the bottom makes them look pretty chintzy. At a $250 MSRP directly competing with airpods, it's very disappointing that the case doesn't have the ultra-wideband built in to be able to use the radar like feature from your phone to find them. The find my feature relies on the buds being out of the case and reliant on chirping noise from the buds to find them. I had to buy a samsung smart tag to attach to the protective case carabiner so I could have this feature. Volume is great on these, they are as loud, if not slightly louder then airpods. I find that battery life on these are excellent. With ANC on the battery is around 6hrs and way longer if you have ANC off.",

After using these for three or four years, I have since moved on to the much happier pair of Galaxy Buds3.Compared to buds I've had before and after, the fit for these was the worst. They would easily slip out of my ears (regardless of which earbud-tip size I attached.) They also hurt to wear, after a while.Something about the case's shape also meant that any time I dropped it, it opened and launched the earbuds into oblivion. They were never damaged, so I guess in that sense it did its job. But it's an awkward thing when it happens, for example, on an airplane.(While we're on the subject: Side-sleepers, beware, these are not the earbuds for you. They stick out too much for that and it hurts.)Battery life is about, eh, 2 - 3 hours. If it starts to die in use, you can keep the case charged and put one bud in there and just keep alternating them.One thing I'm really impressed by is their water-resistance. My cat pushed the case and buds into his water bowl, and after setting them out to dry for a day they functioned as normal.To their credit, the sound is great. They also have intuitive and useful touch-controls, and their noise cancelling is pretty decent. But the other aspects outweighed this for me, I think.The Good:- Sound is great- Touch controls are easy and work well- Noise-canceling is decent- Fantastic water resistanceThe bad:- Short battery life- Pretty uncomfortable to wearThe Ugly:- Them",

I listened to music all day and made a few phone calls on top of a very windy and noisy rooftop.

The voice command for volume is useless, though, because it only changes by a tiny bit, so you would have to keep saying it repeatedly. It would be better if you could say to set the volume at XX%. The swipe controls on the stem work really well, but the pitch controls take some getting used to.Battery life was pretty decent.

They sit close to the ear and don't look obvious when wearing.The sound quality of the earbuds is very good, and the batteries last a few hours on a charge. For listening to music, they rate a solid 5, especially considering their price point.However, the sound quality of the mic leaves much to be desired. I've been told that I sound very muffled and \"distant\" when talking with them. I rarely answer my phone, and when I do callers can still hear me despite the poor sound quality. My main use is for private enjoyment of entertainment on my phone, and for this function I find these quite adequate. However, it would be nice if there was a way to disable them as my phone's mic. I did some research on disabling earbud mics and the methods I found (disabling in the device's Bluetooth settings & also in the Microphone settings) were not successful.",

        "review": "These buds are a big let-down, especially since they are priced and positioned to be the top buds Samsung makes. I'm into personal tech, and I own way too many Apple and Samsung devices. I currently use a Samsung Galaxy Fold 7, and that is the phone I've been using with these buds. I also currently own the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and I also have Apple Earpods Pro as well (also used the Samsung buds with Ipad Pros and Window laptops)Unfortunately, from a reliability stand point, the Apple Earpods Pro work better with my Samsung phone than Samsung's own ear buds.Issues:1. My right ear bud just stopped charging and connecting. I've charged, pulled the bud in and out of the case, pushed it in, re-paired, reset, and I cannot get the right ear bud to charge or connect. Just period, right now, after days of messing with it, the right ear bud doesn't work. I've had these buds for like 3 months.2. Pairing doesn't always activate. Generally, to pair, you open the case and hold the pair button for a few seconds, and it's supposed to enter pairing mode. Unfortunately, with these buds, that process has not worked on several occasions. I noticed this issue seems to happen more often when the buds connect to a previously paired device, and then you try to pair to a new device. Probably a software bug, but common, these are the Pros, and should not have these issues. For comparison, I've never had a pairing issue with my Airpods Pros, Apple or Android device.3. Mic/voice dropouts. On several occasions, when answering a phone call, or doing a Teams call, the audio would work, but the mic would not. The bluetooth settings would say everything is connected (both audio and mic), but for whatever reason, the mic-audio would not work. Probably another software setting, but it happened to me on a couple important work-related calls, and it's one of those things that really makes you lose confidence in the buds. I've had this happen once with the Airpods Pros, but only once.Good things:1. As a techy person, I really liked the LED lights on the blade portion of the buds.2. When it works, big caveat, when it works, the integrated world of Samsung devices is nice (e.g. auto-switch between devices, battery levels, customization, etc).3. I like the look of the case and buds better than the Apply buds.Would I buy again? No. If you're debating between the Samsung buds Pro and the Apply buds Pro, even if you're an Android user, I would recommend going with the Apple Buds Pro.",

        "review": "I have tried a handful of Bluetooth ear buds and have used airpods pro 2 as my daily drivers for the past 2yrs. These sound better and from what I can tell the mics do a better job at noise isolation. There are things that samsung really should change on the next iteration of these. The way they seat into the case could have been better, the angle they sit at I have to turn the ear buds 180 degrees to put them in my ear when pulling them from the case. The triangular shaped stems make it so you have to put them back into the case a certain angle and requires more effort from the user versus with a rounded stem you just get the stem partialy in the case and then the built in magnets helping get them orientated and seated correctly. When adjusting them in my ears, I almost every time hit the haptic button built into the stems that pauses the music. They should have put more thought into the colors. I intentionally didn't go with the white because I didn't want them to look like my previous airpods but the silver color with the blue and red tabs on the bottom makes them look pretty chintzy. At a $250 MSRP directly competing with airpods, it's very disappointing that the case doesn't have the ultra-wideband built in to be able to use the radar like feature from your phone to find them. The find my feature relies on the buds being out of the case and reliant on chirping noise from the buds to find them. I had to buy a samsung smart tag to attach to the protective case carabiner so I could have this feature. Volume is great on these, they are as loud, if not slightly louder then airpods. I find that battery life on these are excellent. With ANC on the battery is around 6hrs and way longer if you have ANC off.",

The only ones that worked for me in the past were the Bose SoundSport. After that, I used Beats Pro over-ear headphones. While they stayed on, I was never truly impressed with the sound quality.I spent weeks researching before purchasing these, and I\u2019m so glad I did. They fit comfortably in my small ears and stay put without any issues. The active noise cancellation is excellent\u2014at the gym, I used to hear conversations and background noise through my old headphones, but with these properly seated, I hear NOTHING at all!The sound quality and clarity are a noticeable upgrade from my old Beats, and I really like being able to adjust the sound through the app. I prefer bass-heavy music, and these deliver. While volume controls on the earbuds themselves would be nice, it\u2019s not a deal breaker since my phone is usually nearby.If you struggle with earbuds staying in your ears and want a high-quality pair of headphones that cost about half the price of other major brands\u2014while performing even better in my opinion\u2014I highly recommend giving these a try!",

        "review": "These are great sounding earbuds and they are fantastic for the price. You really can't get any better. I specifically needed these though because I need a good transparency mode and I didn't want to spend too much for earbuds. I have nicer earbuds that have much better noise canceling but The trade-off with the other earbuds that I have tried was that they had a poor transparency mode so it seems like at this price you kind of get one of the other. The noise canceling isn't terrible on these earbuds it's just that if that is what you want more than anything you can get better on different earbuds. So again if you're looking for a good all-around earbud with great transparency mode go with these. I should also note I have smaller ears and although they are a little bit bulky they fit and they do not fall out. A little tip though, twist them a little bit to get them to grab onto your ear just right.",

        "review": "These Galaxy buds fe are almost perfect.As an audiophile these definitely sound great, a bit of treble sparkle, slightly boosted mids and BASS. While I personally think they sound better than the Method 360 ANC by Skullcandy, they have quite a ways to go to become the perfect earbud.The battery life is not the greatest as I only get 5-6 hours with ANC on. And about 22-24 with the case.The fit is very good, I'm glad to see a stability fin on these. Not only does it make them fit better, but man do the look good. Also speaking of the fin, they do stay in the ear very well, and with their IPX2 rating I've had them drenched in sweat and snow and everything still works so prompts to Samsung.The ANC is good enough as it reduces background noise and softens conversations around.The app experience is very cool, one thing is I downloaded the Wearable app and was told that the app was not needed and that I could access everything from the settings app on my S23. Don't know if it was a UI update or something, but all very cool.Two things. One, the ANC stays off until you go into the settings and change it yourself, so you can have ANC in just one  earbud.Two, the wear detection works but it takes the earbuds a second to realize its not in my ear. Also just a general note I'd like to have a company who makes an earbud with wear detection and it just pauses the earbud you took out and not both earbuds.Overall they are very good earbuds and will be great for a casual listener who wants a Samsung product. These are great!!!",

So bit  bullet and bought these and I'm glad I did. They were easy to connect. They charge great. They fit in the ear perfectly and come with sized earbuds and a few other attachments from outside the ear when the earbuds are in  to adjust for comfort. wasn't too deep in Pocket (if you choose to do a monthly payment plan like I did) comes in into simple yet pretty good looking colors. I must say black and white. I chose white so I can find them even in their case in the case itself fits in the palm of the hand very comfortably and I omit I am bad with taking the earbuds out of the case and sometimes holding the case itself, but in having had these for a bit. I did fumble the case and it didn't fly open which is a blessing The functions in the earbuds themselves are very simple, personally I have absolutely no care that they don't do volume control for me. It's starting stopping and just moving on to the next song and answering calls. They are very excellent for that. They work great. Oh, and let's not forget the sound quality and noise cancellation. It doesn't drown out the environment around you, but it gives a perfect balance of quiet and self-awareness where you can enjoy what you're listening to and not be completely unaware of what's going on around you.",

Though you do need the Samsung Wear app to control them - activate / deactivate the noise canceling feature. Since I keep my phone's Bluetooth turned off, I love the feature where after you take the buds out of their case and put them in your ear, you get a message on your phone asking if you want to connect them. I don't have to manually turn on the Bluetooth. The only drawback it seems is that I can't really use them with my Samsung TV. Although they connect and I can hear the sound, after a bit the sound starts to make digital distortions. But, no such issues when connected to the phone. The battery life is great and lasts up to ~6 hours on the buds. The case can charge the buds a few times before it itself requires charging. The Wear app shows the percentage of charge remaining for both the buds as well as the case. And unlike some other types of buds, these are essy to take out of the case.",

        "review": "I bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE), and let me just say, these are NOT your average earbuds. These are the superhero of sound, the Beyonc\u00e9 of Bluetooth, the James Bond of noise-canceling\u2014basically, they\u2019re everything I never knew I needed in my life, and now I can\u2019t live without them.The Pros:Active Noise-Canceling? More Like Active Life-Changing \u2013 I thought noise-canceling was just a \u201ccool feature,\u201d but NO. These babies don\u2019t just block out the noise, they block out your ENTIRE LIFE. Kids yelling? Gone. Your neighbor\u2019s dog barking at 3 AM? Not even a whisper. The sound of your own thoughts? Who needs them? These buds don\u2019t let anything in\u2026 except for your favorite jams.Earbuds that Fit Like They\u2019re Meant to Be \u2013 If you\u2019ve ever bought earbuds that feel like they\u2019re trying to escape your ears mid-jog, then you know the struggle. These? Fit like a glove (except for your ears, obviously, but you get the point). No slipping, no adjusting, no awkwardly trying to pop them back in when you\u2019re about to give a TED Talk on the importance of \u201cListening to Your Favorite Playlist\u201d (seriously, these fit that snug).Sound Quality That Makes You Feel Like You\u2019re in a Concert Hall \u2013 Every note is crisp, every beat is beyond satisfying, and I swear I could hear the microwave beep in a whole new way. These Galaxy Buds make your favorite music sound like it was made in a recording studio with actual magic. If you want to feel like a rockstar while doing your laundry, these are the buds for you.Touch Controls Are So Futuristic, I Feel Like I\u2019m In a Sci-Fi Movie \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I needed touch controls until I had them. Want to change the song? Just tap the side. Volume too loud? Swipe down like you're controlling the volume of your future robot overlords. I can practically feel my IQ going up with every tap.Battery Life That Lasts Longer Than My Attention Span \u2013 I\u2019ve used these buds for hours and hours, and they still had juice left. It\u2019s like they run on pure, unadulterated energy. I\u2019ve forgotten to charge them overnight and still had a full day of listening ahead of me. The only thing they can\u2019t do is remind me to charge my phone\u2026 but that\u2019s probably coming in the next edition.The Cons:I Might Become a Music Snob \u2013 I never realized how bad my old earbuds were until I put these in. Now, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, this song was supposed to sound like that?\u201d It\u2019s like hearing your favorite song for the first time all over again. Prepare to get snobby about sound quality and turn your nose up at anything less than \u201cactive noise-canceling perfection.\u201dOnce You Put Them In, You Might Never Leave Your House \u2013 Seriously, I put these in while cleaning, and suddenly, I was two hours deep into a podcast and forgot I had even started the dishes. These buds make doing mundane tasks feel like you're in a high-budget music video. Be careful\u2014you might forget how to exist in the real world.Conclusion:The SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE) have elevated my audio game in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible. They cancel noise, they amplify sound, and they make me feel like I could conquer the world (or at least my to-do list) while jamming out to my favorite tunes.If you want earbuds that make you feel like a VIP at a private concert, buy these. If you want to block out your neighbor\u2019s questionable karaoke sessions, buy these. And if you just want to listen to your Spotify playlist like it was meant to be heard\u2014you guessed it\u2014buy these.TL;DR: These are the best earbuds I\u2019ve ever had, and I now believe they might be secretly part of a government experiment to make us all smarter, more productive, and significantly cooler. Highly recommend.",

In my opinion, these are a steal because they have the same quality sound, and noise canceling as the $300 ones at a fraction of the price. They stay perfectly in my ears and the battery life is over 6 hours even when listening at higher volumes nonstop. Save some money and go for these. You won't be disappointed",

        "review": "About 5 years ago Samsung released the legendary Galaxy Buds Live in August of 2020I was fortunate enough to be able to receive buds live with an s22 ultra from Samsung in 2021, those buds have been my daily driver's since thenWe are talking all day long from work, to the ride home and throughout my night and even through sleep on some occasionsFinding a replacement for the buds live is challenging, I was not lucky enough to grab a new pair at retail before they were discontinued and my old buds have various issues between charging to audio quality but now is the time they get replacedThe new buds 3 were a somewhat confusing decision only due to Amazon having a separate more expensive version with a two year warranty and some issue with shipping but whateverAfter my first use I am very blown away, I have only turned them up to about 1/3 the max volume but they are noticeably louder than my buds live which have to be turned up until two notches past the volume warning to hear under certain circumstancesThe fit in the ear is much better due to the larger design and the speaker hole is also bigger so the sound isn't so cannedThe price was ok about 100 but I can't speak for the battery life or anything else yetIf there was one thing I don't like it's the stem controls but in comparison to the buds live with a touch sensor on the exterior that always didn't function correctly... Even with touches blocked it would still hang up calls so I had to use good lock to make a custom event where if I double tap the power button it enabled touches blocked but I had to do this Everytime I switch earphones or if I go from a video to answering a call it would re enable touchesI paired my buds with a locking case from Spigen. Not happy that you have to glue the top on but Spigen gives you a spare adhesive strip and so far it doesn't seem like it will come apart easily",

        "review": "TLDR; These are great, even at MSRP. I wish I bought these when they came out. Sale prices make these a no brainer, especially for those that don't want rubber tips in their ears. Battery life is decent and all play/pause and volume swipe functions work in Windows 11 without the app installed.This will include comparisons to AirPods 4 ANC:I've been using AirPods 4 on my PC for a while and they've worked fine.  My personal gripe is that the stem doesn't have the volume swipe gestures like the AirPods Pro 2/3.  Maybe Apple will add this for AirPods 5 in the future, but guess what these have now. That's right, I can now adjust volume as well.Fitment will depend of the person, like most earbuds, but these feel just slightly larger in general so in my case, they fit fine.Sound quality seems fine.  I'm no audiophile but these sound good with a hint more bass than the Airpods but I believe this can be adjusted.Wireless charging works like it should and I've got some Ringke cases on the way to get them to latch on to magsage chargers.Note, there is software for Windows 11 already and it looks basic but it seemingly gives you a better idea of the buds battery life instead of the built in Windows bluetooth page staying at 100% until you reconnect them to reflect the actual battery life. And speaking of, battery life is good.  Granted these are brand new but they seemingly went the full 5-6 hours when switching noise cancelling on and off.I initially thought these had a transparency mode but looks like these simply don't.  So the Airpods 4 ANC get a slight edge, but I'm taking the volume control over that.  I would love for these to come out in a variety of colors, not just because options would be nice, but since I've got two pairs, the different colors would make it much more obvious which pair goes where. That's another thing the Ringke cases will help with.Well done Samsung.",

They feel like they're going to fall out, but they never did, and I was climbing ladders, bending over, etc. The looser fit is much more comfortable. They don't make my ears sore or itchy like the Galaxy buds 2 did.The sound quality and noise cancellation were surprisingly good, considering the looser-feeling fit. I listened to music all day and made a few phone calls on top of a very windy and noisy rooftop. The sound quality is much better than that of the Galaxy Buds 2, and the ANC blocked the noise from the loud HVAC unit I was working next to.I really love that they allow you to change songs, stop/start music, and change volume just by saying it, without saying \"Hey Google\" or doing anything else. The voice command for volume is useless, though, because it only changes by a tiny bit, so you would have to keep saying it repeatedly. It would be better if you could say to set the volume at XX%. The swipe controls on the stem work really well, but the pitch controls take some getting used to.Battery life was pretty decent. I didn't keep track, but they worked for about 3-4 hours with music at full volume. I may buy a second pair so I can having one set charging while I use the other set",

My mine gripe is that the earpieces have an ok at best fit, causing them them to fall out during exercises. They also pick up wind making them less then ideal when riding bikes or running.Was worried about this product as it was cheaper than any other seller, but the product itself was in great shape and was good quality. I would never spend 200+ on these headphones, but they were a steal paying 120.",

        "review": "These earbuds were super easy to pair to my iPhone 16e. They are pretty comfortable, especially compared to the old wired earbuds that I used back in the Dark Ages. They sit close to the ear and don't look obvious when wearing.The sound quality of the earbuds is very good, and the batteries last a few hours on a charge. For listening to music, they rate a solid 5, especially considering their price point.However, the sound quality of the mic leaves much to be desired. I've been told that I sound very muffled and \"distant\" when talking with them. I rarely answer my phone, and when I do callers can still hear me despite the poor sound quality. My main use is for private enjoyment of entertainment on my phone, and for this function I find these quite adequate. However, it would be nice if there was a way to disable them as my phone's mic. I did some research on disabling earbud mics and the methods I found (disabling in the device's Bluetooth settings & also in the Microphone settings) were not successful.",

I hope the pro buds 4 do away with the stupid stem design and go back to this compact style.",

Sound quality is decent (kinda like the first edition) but for some reason,I can't adjust volume by tapping the buds which I could do with my other SGBP2 I got from Samsung Store. Also,I didn't get extra earbuds for other sizes but it's a good thing that the one that came with it was perfect fit. So yeah,we're just getting our money's worth.",

I love to stick with things and i love comfort and i don't like the unpredictability of new things.My Samsung Buds2 tip got spoiled plus it's no longer as loud, while working out last week, the left side of my Buds+ went out. I did everything i could and even called Samsung to no avail. I have small ears and so i really loved my previous buds. I was really apprehensive towards these ones being that they don't look as compact as the last ones I own. When i got them, they did not have the original box, so i was even more apprehensive and thought to myself I will surely be returning this. BUT, upon opening it, it was clean and no visible damage or anything.So far, the sound quality blew my mind immediately i put it on, I got chills. Also, upon taking a picture of it on my S24+ to leave this review, it automatically gave me option to pair(interesting). I hadn't had it on for long before the battery ran out but i can't comment on this because i do not know if it was fully charge(update later on this).The fit is also something I'll have to get used to as my ears are small(I loved the fit of the Buds+ better). It also has some settings that are not available on the other sets i have such as-\"Voice Detect\"(reduces volume if it detects your voice incase you are having a conversation while listening so you don't have to take them off)-\"Head tracking\"(adjusts volume according to how you turn your head)-Neck Stretch reminders(incase you bend your head too much looking at your screen).Now i waiting a few days to post this review( 03/02/25). I'd have to say although i really love the sound quality, but i have to constantly adjust it in my ears alot more than i did my last two especially when i go jogging/running. Literally every few seconds. Annoying...but I don't think I'll return it because i don't have a better audio option for the price point at this time. Also, it doesn't have the volume touch controls like the previous ones.07/06/25: Update.This is a long overdue update. Now i get why it was on refurbished sale. The earbuds are horrible for calls which are very important for me. No one can here me on the phone if i use them which is pretty annoying since it was one of the most important reasons i bought them.",

        "review": "I had a Buds Pro I got a few years ago, and then I guess they fell out of my pocket while I was out because they're gone. So I got these.Fit feels a little better than the Pros did, but I'm probably imagining that. Connects to the wear app easily and well, allowing control such as changing from surround sound to ambient sounds. Love that you can turn off touch controls. My ears are garbage at holding buds in so I constantly have to push them back in. (It's not an incorrectly sized ear-tip. Large is way too big, medium doesn't get a perfect grip. Broken ears.)I will admit I haven't tried the call option, as I seldom get calls, and haven't at all while wearing them. I do know the original Pros worked great though. Just tested it calling someone. Both of us noticed no sound issues. They didn't know I wasn't using my phone and they sounded normal to me.I am kinda sad color-wise. The original Pros had a like, glittery-ness to them, the the buds themselves were mirror-like. These are just a plain pastel purple, which I still like but don't think is as pretty. However, I think part of that is the material on the outside of the box is more tacky. The originals were smooth, and I imagine the change was to keep them from easily falling out of your pocket. The biggest issue is, if you have the white or purple, they smudge visibly easier.I had hoped that the find your earbuds option was for if you misplaced the whole thing, but it's simply for if you drop a bud and cant find it, which is disappointing.I can't give a good estimate on battery life. I just spent the past twenty minutes in a call and  the buds went down 5% I don't use them a lot because I'm disabled so I don't go out much, and I've never looked at the battery% once I was done. I will say my box is still at 21% after using them for probably around 15-18 hours, so that's not bad at least.",

        "review": "I have every wireless earbud model that Samsung has made thus far. I cannot recommend Galaxy Buds 2 Pro enough.The sound is remarkable, simply put.Turning on the 360 audio feature on them changes everything, I don't even know how it's possible to feel like the sound is coming from everywhere besides the things sitting in your ears.The active noice canceling is shocking, it's substantially better than just a generation ago in the buds 2.  My window is right next to a main road in my town, and I can sit right in front of it, watching cars go by 15 feet away, without anything playing in the earbuds, and not hear the cars at all. Blows my mind.Generally buds with wingtips fit best in my ears, and they give me more confidence wearing them in active conditions, jogging, biking, cleaning, etc. The Buds 2 never stayed in my ears very well, constant adjustments, the Buds Pro were even worse, and produced unbearable pain in my ears due to their size, geometry, and weight. I was frankly expecting a similar outcome with these Buds 2 Pro, I was instead very surprised to find out that they fit and stay in my ears better than even the Buds FE and other wingtipped buds. I can wear them indefinitely without discomfort, and rarely have to adjust their position in my ears. I do not know how they pulled this off. They are noticeably lighter than previous buds, this surely plays a role.  (I understand the fitment will vary by individual)Battery life is also perfectly sufficient for most people's listening habits, I would imagine. The old Buds+ and their 11+ hours have spoiled me though, and leave me wanting more with all the Buds I've had since, but, I can't really complain with these specifically, ~6 hours is a fine tradeoff if it means lighter buds with better drivers.I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell you why these sound great, but they do, that is certain.HIGHLY recommend.",

The sound quality is superb and branded by AKG and the price is reasonable specifically as Samsung always gives special offer! The volume control cannot be done through the buds, but it is okay and perfect. I found the battery life enough for at least one day and use of usb type-c port and wireless charging is another plus point I could consider!",

        "review": "I have always used cheaper Bluetooth wireless headsets for my phone, but on a recent trip to Utah I decided to splurge. I don't know why I didn't sooner. These are super comfortable in the ears and the noise canceling is absolutely amazing. I would compare it to my Bose headphones that I wear when I'm at home in the quality of the noise canceling. If you pair them with a Samsung phone, you get even more additional features that are just mind blowing compared to your cheap Bluetooth headsets.So I leave it in this if you have a Samsung Galaxy Device absolutely think about spending the money and buying a set of fees you will not regret it. Only one complaint I have, the flip up lid of the charger case comes open very easily, every now and then you'll lose the headphones in your pocket or if you drop the case they will go flying. They have even bounced off into puddles and into a toilet at one point. Drive them off quickly and both of them have still worked for month since I got them. Other than the case I have nothing bad to say about these things can't wait to see the next iteration.",

        "review": "Bought these as an upgrade from mid - level Jlab wireless headphones. The primary reason that I wanted an upgrade from my old Jlab headphones was the quality of making calls. Honestly other than that I had no issues with my old ones. After buying these I tested the sound quality for calls. IT MAKES PHONE CALLS WITH SUPER GOOD QUALITY. It did exactly what I had got them for! I was a little sad however, to realize that the noise cancelling mode had actually decreased in quality. Initially I could not tell a difference between regular off mode and noise cancelling. Then I discovered I had some bigger ear tips. This did make a decent difference, however the noise cancelling just still never was as good as my old headphones (and to be honest they were not like the most insane at it either). I think I'm gonna try and find some better tips online that will help with noise cancelling and see what happens.Overall:Phone call quality: AMAZINGTec and features: A little sensitive but overall really well doneOverall feel in the ears etc: Not bad at allNoise cancelling mode: Mid at bestAmbient Noise mode: GreatWorth the upgrade from $70 Jlab wireless headphones: Overall yes",

        "review": "These buds are a big let-down, especially since they are priced and positioned to be the top buds Samsung makes. I'm into personal tech, and I own way too many Apple and Samsung devices. I currently use a Samsung Galaxy Fold 7, and that is the phone I've been using with these buds. I also currently own the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and I also have Apple Earpods Pro as well (also used the Samsung buds with Ipad Pros and Window laptops)Unfortunately, from a reliability stand point, the Apple Earpods Pro work better with my Samsung phone than Samsung's own ear buds.Issues:1. My right ear bud just stopped charging and connecting. I've charged, pulled the bud in and out of the case, pushed it in, re-paired, reset, and I cannot get the right ear bud to charge or connect. Just period, right now, after days of messing with it, the right ear bud doesn't work. I've had these buds for like 3 months.2. Pairing doesn't always activate. Generally, to pair, you open the case and hold the pair button for a few seconds, and it's supposed to enter pairing mode. Unfortunately, with these buds, that process has not worked on several occasions. I noticed this issue seems to happen more often when the buds connect to a previously paired device, and then you try to pair to a new device. Probably a software bug, but common, these are the Pros, and should not have these issues. For comparison, I've never had a pairing issue with my Airpods Pros, Apple or Android device.3. Mic/voice dropouts. On several occasions, when answering a phone call, or doing a Teams call, the audio would work, but the mic would not. The bluetooth settings would say everything is connected (both audio and mic), but for whatever reason, the mic-audio would not work. Probably another software setting, but it happened to me on a couple important work-related calls, and it's one of those things that really makes you lose confidence in the buds. I've had this happen once with the Airpods Pros, but only once.Good things:1. As a techy person, I really liked the LED lights on the blade portion of the buds.2. When it works, big caveat, when it works, the integrated world of Samsung devices is nice (e.g. auto-switch between devices, battery levels, customization, etc).3. I like the look of the case and buds better than the Apply buds.Would I buy again? No. If you're debating between the Samsung buds Pro and the Apply buds Pro, even if you're an Android user, I would recommend going with the Apple Buds Pro.",

        "review": "I have tried a handful of Bluetooth ear buds and have used airpods pro 2 as my daily drivers for the past 2yrs. These sound better and from what I can tell the mics do a better job at noise isolation. There are things that samsung really should change on the next iteration of these. The way they seat into the case could have been better, the angle they sit at I have to turn the ear buds 180 degrees to put them in my ear when pulling them from the case. The triangular shaped stems make it so you have to put them back into the case a certain angle and requires more effort from the user versus with a rounded stem you just get the stem partialy in the case and then the built in magnets helping get them orientated and seated correctly. When adjusting them in my ears, I almost every time hit the haptic button built into the stems that pauses the music. They should have put more thought into the colors. I intentionally didn't go with the white because I didn't want them to look like my previous airpods but the silver color with the blue and red tabs on the bottom makes them look pretty chintzy. At a $250 MSRP directly competing with airpods, it's very disappointing that the case doesn't have the ultra-wideband built in to be able to use the radar like feature from your phone to find them. The find my feature relies on the buds being out of the case and reliant on chirping noise from the buds to find them. I had to buy a samsung smart tag to attach to the protective case carabiner so I could have this feature. Volume is great on these, they are as loud, if not slightly louder then airpods. I find that battery life on these are excellent. With ANC on the battery is around 6hrs and way longer if you have ANC off.",

The Phantom Violet color is vibrant and adds a stylish touch.  However, they tend to slip out during workouts, and the battery life is decent but not exceptional.  Overall, a solid purchase for the price.",

        "review": "I wanted to love these Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro in Phantom Silver. Really, I did. They looked sleek, sounded crisp, and the noise canceling was so good I couldn\u2019t hear my neighbor\u2019s lawnmower OR his terrible karaoke. For a brief, shining moment, I thought we had a future together.Then the romance ended.Battery life: Nonexistent. These things died faster than my motivation on a Monday morning.Fit: Imagine throwing a bar of soap in your ear and hoping it stays. Spoiler: it doesn\u2019t. I tried all three sizes of tips. My ears rejected them like an organ transplant gone wrong.Connection: The sound cut in and out like they were trying to Morse code me a distress signal. (Probably saying \u201creturn me, please.\u201d)To be fair, when they did work, they sounded fantastic. Crisp highs, solid bass, and the noise reduction could probably drown out my mother-in-law\u2019s \u201chelpful suggestions.\u201dBut after two days of frustration, I\u2019m packing them up and sending them home. Good sound, terrible everything else.Final verdict: Great for a demo. Terrible for real life. Unless you enjoy chasing earbuds across the floor like a toddler chasing Skittles.",

        "review": "I upgraded to these after losing my beloved Galaxy Buds+ and was mildly disappointed. After using these for three or four years, I have since moved on to the much happier pair of Galaxy Buds3.Compared to buds I've had before and after, the fit for these was the worst. They would easily slip out of my ears (regardless of which earbud-tip size I attached.) They also hurt to wear, after a while.Something about the case's shape also meant that any time I dropped it, it opened and launched the earbuds into oblivion. They were never damaged, so I guess in that sense it did its job. But it's an awkward thing when it happens, for example, on an airplane.(While we're on the subject: Side-sleepers, beware, these are not the earbuds for you. They stick out too much for that and it hurts.)Battery life is about, eh, 2 - 3 hours. If it starts to die in use, you can keep the case charged and put one bud in there and just keep alternating them.One thing I'm really impressed by is their water-resistance. My cat pushed the case and buds into his water bowl, and after setting them out to dry for a day they functioned as normal.To their credit, the sound is great. They also have intuitive and useful touch-controls, and their noise cancelling is pretty decent. But the other aspects outweighed this for me, I think.The Good:- Sound is great- Touch controls are easy and work well- Noise-canceling is decent- Fantastic water resistanceThe bad:- Short battery life- Pretty uncomfortable to wearThe Ugly:- Them",

        "review": "I only received them yesterday, but after using them all day, I love them.The fit is different from any other earbuds I've used. They feel like they're going to fall out, but they never did, and I was climbing ladders, bending over, etc. The looser fit is much more comfortable. They don't make my ears sore or itchy like the Galaxy buds 2 did.The sound quality and noise cancellation were surprisingly good, considering the looser-feeling fit. I listened to music all day and made a few phone calls on top of a very windy and noisy rooftop. The sound quality is much better than that of the Galaxy Buds 2, and the ANC blocked the noise from the loud HVAC unit I was working next to.I really love that they allow you to change songs, stop/start music, and change volume just by saying it, without saying \"Hey Google\" or doing anything else. The voice command for volume is useless, though, because it only changes by a tiny bit, so you would have to keep saying it repeatedly. It would be better if you could say to set the volume at XX%. The swipe controls on the stem work really well, but the pitch controls take some getting used to.Battery life was pretty decent. I didn't keep track, but they worked for about 3-4 hours with music at full volume. I may buy a second pair so I can having one set charging while I use the other set",

I cannot recommend Galaxy Buds 2 Pro enough.The sound is remarkable, simply put.Turning on the 360 audio feature on them changes everything, I don't even know how it's possible to feel like the sound is coming from everywhere besides the things sitting in your ears.The active noice canceling is shocking, it's substantially better than just a generation ago in the buds 2.  My window is right next to a main road in my town, and I can sit right in front of it, watching cars go by 15 feet away, without anything playing in the earbuds, and not hear the cars at all. Blows my mind.Generally buds with wingtips fit best in my ears, and they give me more confidence wearing them in active conditions, jogging, biking, cleaning, etc. The Buds 2 never stayed in my ears very well, constant adjustments, the Buds Pro were even worse, and produced unbearable pain in my ears due to their size, geometry, and weight. I was frankly expecting a similar outcome with these Buds 2 Pro, I was instead very surprised to find out that they fit and stay in my ears better than even the Buds FE and other wingtipped buds. I can wear them indefinitely without discomfort, and rarely have to adjust their position in my ears. I do not know how they pulled this off. They are noticeably lighter than previous buds, this surely plays a role.  (I understand the fitment will vary by individual)Battery life is also perfectly sufficient for most people's listening habits, I would imagine. The old Buds+ and their 11+ hours have spoiled me though, and leave me wanting more with all the Buds I've had since, but, I can't really complain with these specifically, ~6 hours is a fine tradeoff if it means lighter buds with better drivers.I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell you why these sound great, but they do, that is certain.HIGHLY recommend.",

I don't have to manually turn on the Bluetooth. The only drawback it seems is that I can't really use them with my Samsung TV. Although they connect and I can hear the sound, after a bit the sound starts to make digital distortions. But, no such issues when connected to the phone. The battery life is great and lasts up to ~6 hours on the buds. The case can charge the buds a few times before it itself requires charging.

        "review": "I bought the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE), and let me just say, these are NOT your average earbuds. These are the superhero of sound, the Beyonc\u00e9 of Bluetooth, the James Bond of noise-canceling\u2014basically, they\u2019re everything I never knew I needed in my life, and now I can\u2019t live without them.The Pros:Active Noise-Canceling? More Like Active Life-Changing \u2013 I thought noise-canceling was just a \u201ccool feature,\u201d but NO. These babies don\u2019t just block out the noise, they block out your ENTIRE LIFE. Kids yelling? Gone. Your neighbor\u2019s dog barking at 3 AM? Not even a whisper. The sound of your own thoughts? Who needs them? These buds don\u2019t let anything in\u2026 except for your favorite jams.Earbuds that Fit Like They\u2019re Meant to Be \u2013 If you\u2019ve ever bought earbuds that feel like they\u2019re trying to escape your ears mid-jog, then you know the struggle. These? Fit like a glove (except for your ears, obviously, but you get the point). No slipping, no adjusting, no awkwardly trying to pop them back in when you\u2019re about to give a TED Talk on the importance of \u201cListening to Your Favorite Playlist\u201d (seriously, these fit that snug).Sound Quality That Makes You Feel Like You\u2019re in a Concert Hall \u2013 Every note is crisp, every beat is beyond satisfying, and I swear I could hear the microwave beep in a whole new way. These Galaxy Buds make your favorite music sound like it was made in a recording studio with actual magic. If you want to feel like a rockstar while doing your laundry, these are the buds for you.Touch Controls Are So Futuristic, I Feel Like I\u2019m In a Sci-Fi Movie \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I needed touch controls until I had them. Want to change the song? Just tap the side. Volume too loud? Swipe down like you're controlling the volume of your future robot overlords. I can practically feel my IQ going up with every tap.Battery Life That Lasts Longer Than My Attention Span \u2013 I\u2019ve used these buds for hours and hours, and they still had juice left. It\u2019s like they run on pure, unadulterated energy. I\u2019ve forgotten to charge them overnight and still had a full day of listening ahead of me. The only thing they can\u2019t do is remind me to charge my phone\u2026 but that\u2019s probably coming in the next edition.The Cons:I Might Become a Music Snob \u2013 I never realized how bad my old earbuds were until I put these in. Now, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, this song was supposed to sound like that?\u201d It\u2019s like hearing your favorite song for the first time all over again. Prepare to get snobby about sound quality and turn your nose up at anything less than \u201cactive noise-canceling perfection.\u201dOnce You Put Them In, You Might Never Leave Your House \u2013 Seriously, I put these in while cleaning, and suddenly, I was two hours deep into a podcast and forgot I had even started the dishes. These buds make doing mundane tasks feel like you're in a high-budget music video. Be careful\u2014you might forget how to exist in the real world.Conclusion:The SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Fan Edition (FE) have elevated my audio game in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible. They cancel noise, they amplify sound, and they make me feel like I could conquer the world (or at least my to-do list) while jamming out to my favorite tunes.If you want earbuds that make you feel like a VIP at a private concert, buy these. If you want to block out your neighbor\u2019s questionable karaoke sessions, buy these. And if you just want to listen to your Spotify playlist like it was meant to be heard\u2014you guessed it\u2014buy these.TL;DR: These are the best earbuds I\u2019ve ever had, and I now believe they might be secretly part of a government experiment to make us all smarter, more productive, and significantly cooler. Highly recommend.",

In my opinion, these are a steal because they have the same quality sound, and noise canceling as the $300 ones at a fraction of the price. They stay perfectly in my ears and the battery life is over 6 hours even when listening at higher volumes nonstop. Save some money and go for these. You won't be disappointed",

        "review": "It works great! I bought it refurbished and it definitely an upgrade from the original Buds Pro! Better noise canceling, sound and better design as well! It does work with older models such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. The case fells so nice but can easily get scratched if left in pocket with car keys and other hard objects. Battery life is not bad at all, as both buds can last 2+ hours or more, even if you you use it longer and the battery dies out, it charges super quickly. The case should charge the earbuds 3 around full battery cycles, more or less. I've read reviews  about the bad comfort from the Buds 3 so I chose this one, refurbished. Good as new!",

These buds are awesome!  I am sure if you find some in good condition you will agree.Tech KingsThis is the seller which I purchased these from.  They were clean and pound just as hard as my first pair.  They come with a short charging cord and only 2 sets of tips.  Was a little disappointed about that as my first came with 3 pair.Be smart when cleaning!I use these a lot!  That being said these buds get dirty. Be easy when cleaning them!  I ruined my first pair and had to order replacements.  I would do so again in a heartbeat as I love them.  I hope the pro buds 4 do away with the stupid stem design and go back to this compact style.",

Sound quality is decent (kinda like the first edition) but for some reason,I can't adjust volume by tapping the buds which I could do with my other SGBP2 I got from Samsung Store. Also,I didn't get extra earbuds for other sizes but it's a good thing that the one that came with it was perfect fit. So yeah,we're just getting our money's worth.",

I love to stick with things and i love comfort and i don't like the unpredictability of new things.My Samsung Buds2 tip got spoiled plus it's no longer as loud, while working out last week, the left side of my Buds+ went out. I did everything i could and even called Samsung to no avail. I have small ears and so i really loved my previous buds. I was really apprehensive towards these ones being that they don't look as compact as the last ones I own. When i got them, they did not have the original box, so i was even more apprehensive and thought to myself I will surely be returning this. BUT, upon opening it, it was clean and no visible damage or anything.So far, the sound quality blew my mind immediately i put it on, I got chills. Also, upon taking a picture of it on my S24+ to leave this review, it automatically gave me option to pair(interesting). I hadn't had it on for long before the battery ran out but i can't comment on this because i do not know if it was fully charge(update later on this).The fit is also something I'll have to get used to as my ears are small(I loved the fit of the Buds+ better). It also has some settings that are not available on the other sets i have such as-\"Voice Detect\"(reduces volume if it detects your voice incase you are having a conversation while listening so you don't have to take them off)-\"Head tracking\"(adjusts volume according to how you turn your head)-Neck Stretch reminders(incase you bend your head too much looking at your screen).Now i waiting a few days to post this review( 03/02/25). I'd have to say although i really love the sound quality, but i have to constantly adjust it in my ears alot more than i did my last two especially when i go jogging/running. Literally every few seconds. Annoying...but I don't think I'll return it because i don't have a better audio option for the price point at this time. Also, it doesn't have the volume touch controls like the previous ones.07/06/25: Update.This is a long overdue update. Now i get why it was on refurbished sale. The earbuds are horrible for calls which are very important for me. No one can here me on the phone if i use them which is pretty annoying since it was one of the most important reasons i bought them.",

        "review": "I had a Buds Pro I got a few years ago, and then I guess they fell out of my pocket while I was out because they're gone. So I got these.Fit feels a little better than the Pros did, but I'm probably imagining that. Connects to the wear app easily and well, allowing control such as changing from surround sound to ambient sounds. Love that you can turn off touch controls. My ears are garbage at holding buds in so I constantly have to push them back in. (It's not an incorrectly sized ear-tip. Large is way too big, medium doesn't get a perfect grip. Broken ears.)I will admit I haven't tried the call option, as I seldom get calls, and haven't at all while wearing them. I do know the original Pros worked great though. Just tested it calling someone. Both of us noticed no sound issues. They didn't know I wasn't using my phone and they sounded normal to me.I am kinda sad color-wise. The original Pros had a like, glittery-ness to them, the the buds themselves were mirror-like. These are just a plain pastel purple, which I still like but don't think is as pretty. However, I think part of that is the material on the outside of the box is more tacky. The originals were smooth, and I imagine the change was to keep them from easily falling out of your pocket. The biggest issue is, if you have the white or purple, they smudge visibly easier.I had hoped that the find your earbuds option was for if you misplaced the whole thing, but it's simply for if you drop a bud and cant find it, which is disappointing.I can't give a good estimate on battery life. I just spent the past twenty minutes in a call and  the buds went down 5% I don't use them a lot because I'm disabled so I don't go out much, and I've never looked at the battery% once I was done. I will say my box is still at 21% after using them for probably around 15-18 hours, so that's not bad at least.",

The redesign of the comfort fit means that these buds will stay intact even during the most rigorous workouts or prolonged listening to of music. The design of the headphones follows the contours of the head enhancing on noise cancellation thus providing the user with toch sound without interruption.When it comes to sound, and you will be hard pressed to find a better set of true wireless earphones than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

The sound optimization which is done through AI enhances the sound to meet your specific preference as a user. The end product is clear and dynamic sound that is at par with wired headphones\u2019 experience.This is complemented by the noise cancellation function integrated into these earphones. Just like all Samsung\u2019s gadgets the noise cancelling feature is very much advanced and there was no interference of outside noise when I listened to my audio content. Even when all you need is to listen to your music/library, or if you have a work/business to attend to, you can exercise the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro noise cancellation feature.But more is still on store, in the lines of innovation. The real-time built-in interpreter will ensure that you don\u2019t leave a meeting or during your foreign trip stranded for words during the meeting. It employs an AI algorithm that allows you to translate up to 16 languages from the location of your travel to avoid communication barriers.The other fact that differentiates the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro from another is the battery power of this accessory. To provide a small overall volume, these compact earbuds are equipped with efficient design and mighty battery that allows recording 29 hours of playback time. This means you can listen to any type of audio content for days without having to plug your earphones to a charger.With regards to connectivity, it\u2019s got simple pairing and smart switching between devices in line with Bluetooth 5.3. If you have any other Samsung device, the company\u2019s well-integrated experience guarantees that your Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will always be waiting for connection.Finally, a 2-year warranty exclusively available on Amazon also means that your beautific investment will serve shelter for potential flaws in the device.If you want to buy truly wireless earbuds, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has that feature down pat, robust sound quality, additional bells and whistles, and ergonomic design of the earbuds. If you intend to find lose a pair of wireless earbuds that may serve your active lifestyle whilst providing the best sound quality, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro should definitely fit the bill.

        "review": "Actually worth the price. The pinch function works great, the ANC is great, the volume is spectacular, and they fit in my ear for my 6 mile run today and didn't fall out even remotely (despite that i sweat a lot). The case is compact and everything is very well built, although the case feels a bit \"plastic-y\". Just be cautious with that. They are pretty comfortable as well, the M size nibs fit for me. The connectivity is of course very quick and took me less than a minute to set it up right. No fooling around with EQs necessarry either- for most. They sound fantastic out the box. If you're a bit of an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate the experience for all genres. I suspect if you like a lot of hip hop/rap/pop/electronic music you may want to hike up the bass and scoop the mids a bit. And for rock/metal/country/jazz/classical these will sound great as is but i lowered the 4k a bit and boosted the 63 and 125 to give it a slight bump in bass still for personal preference. Highly recommend overall, especially if you have a Samsung as it fits well into the ecosystem. No comment on battery life as this is just 1 good day of use,  but I'm assuming it will work for my purposes and just need to charge up daily/every other day (if that? Maybe better?) which is okay either way.",

The soundstage is wider and the call clarity is the best I\u2019ve experienced on a pair of stems.The Pros:The Fit: They feel more secure than the previous 'bean' or 'bud' shapes. I can wear them for hours without ear fatigue.ANC Performance: The Active Noise Canceling is top-tier. It easily drowns out low-frequency hums like plane engines or office chatter.Sound Quality: Crisp highs and a punchy bass that doesn't feel muddy.The One Con: If you like to sing along to your music, turn off the Voice Detect/Adaptive mode. The AI is so sensitive that it thinks I\u2019m trying to start a conversation whenever I sing a lyric, and it immediately lowers the music volume. It\u2019s a great feature for an office, but a total buzzkill for solo jam sessions.Verdict: Incredible hardware. Just be prepared to dive into the Wearable app settings to customize the AI features to your liking.",

        "review": "These earbuds were super easy to pair to my iPhone 16e. They are pretty comfortable, especially compared to the old wired earbuds that I used back in the Dark Ages. They sit close to the ear and don't look obvious when wearing.The sound quality of the earbuds is very good, and the batteries last a few hours on a charge. For listening to music, they rate a solid 5, especially considering their price point.However, the sound quality of the mic leaves much to be desired. I've been told that I sound very muffled and \"distant\" when talking with them. I rarely answer my phone, and when I do callers can still hear me despite the poor sound quality. My main use is for private enjoyment of entertainment on my phone, and for this function I find these quite adequate. However, it would be nice if there was a way to disable them as my phone's mic. I did some research on disabling earbud mics and the methods I found (disabling in the device's Bluetooth settings & also in the Microphone settings) were not successful.",

They looked sleek, sounded crisp, and the noise canceling was so good I couldn\u2019t hear my neighbor\u2019s lawnmower OR his terrible karaoke. For a brief, shining moment, I thought we had a future together.Then the romance ended.Battery life: Nonexistent. These things died faster than my motivation on a Monday morning.Fit: Imagine throwing a bar of soap in your ear and hoping it stays. Spoiler: it doesn\u2019t. I tried all three sizes of tips. My ears rejected them like an organ transplant gone wrong.Connection: The sound cut in and out like they were trying to Morse code me a distress signal. (Probably saying \u201creturn me, please.\u201d)To be fair, when they did work, they sounded fantastic. Crisp highs, solid bass, and the noise reduction could probably drown out my mother-in-law\u2019s \u201chelpful suggestions.\u201dBut after two days of frustration, I\u2019m packing them up and sending them home. Good sound, terrible everything else.Final verdict: Great for a demo. Terrible for real life. Unless you enjoy chasing earbuds across the floor like a toddler chasing Skittles.",

        "review": "I upgraded to these after losing my beloved Galaxy Buds+ and was mildly disappointed. After using these for three or four years, I have since moved on to the much happier pair of Galaxy Buds3.Compared to buds I've had before and after, the fit for these was the worst. They would easily slip out of my ears (regardless of which earbud-tip size I attached.) They also hurt to wear, after a while.Something about the case's shape also meant that any time I dropped it, it opened and launched the earbuds into oblivion. They were never damaged, so I guess in that sense it did its job. But it's an awkward thing when it happens, for example, on an airplane.(While we're on the subject: Side-sleepers, beware, these are not the earbuds for you. They stick out too much for that and it hurts.)Battery life is about, eh, 2 - 3 hours. If it starts to die in use, you can keep the case charged and put one bud in there and just keep alternating them.One thing I'm really impressed by is their water-resistance. My cat pushed the case and buds into his water bowl, and after setting them out to dry for a day they functioned as normal.To their credit, the sound is great. They also have intuitive and useful touch-controls, and their noise cancelling is pretty decent. But the other aspects outweighed this for me, I think.The Good:- Sound is great- Touch controls are easy and work well- Noise-canceling is decent- Fantastic water resistanceThe bad:- Short battery life- Pretty uncomfortable to wearThe Ugly:- Them",

        "review": "I only received them yesterday, but after using them all day, I love them.The fit is different from any other earbuds I've used. They feel like they're going to fall out, but they never did, and I was climbing ladders, bending over, etc. The looser fit is much more comfortable. They don't make my ears sore or itchy like the Galaxy buds 2 did.The sound quality and noise cancellation were surprisingly good, considering the looser-feeling fit. I listened to music all day and made a few phone calls on top of a very windy and noisy rooftop. The sound quality is much better than that of the Galaxy Buds 2, and the ANC blocked the noise from the loud HVAC unit I was working next to.I really love that they allow you to change songs, stop/start music, and change volume just by saying it, without saying \"Hey Google\" or doing anything else. The voice command for volume is useless, though, because it only changes by a tiny bit, so you would have to keep saying it repeatedly. It would be better if you could say to set the volume at XX%. The swipe controls on the stem work really well, but the pitch controls take some getting used to.Battery life was pretty decent. I didn't keep track, but they worked for about 3-4 hours with music at full volume. I may buy a second pair so I can having one set charging while I use the other set",

The Bluetooth 5.3 technology delivers a stable and seamless connection, allowing me to enjoy crystal-clear audio without any interruptions or lag. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlist or taking calls on the go, the sound quality is consistently impressive, with deep bass and crisp highs that rival even premium wired headphones.The touch controls are another standout feature, offering intuitive navigation with a simple tap or swipe.

I love to stick with things and i love comfort and i don't like the unpredictability of new things.My Samsung Buds2 tip got spoiled plus it's no longer as loud, while working out last week, the left side of my Buds+ went out.

I was really apprehensive towards these ones being that they don't look as compact as the last ones I own. When i got them, they did not have the original box, so i was even more apprehensive and thought to myself I will surely be returning this.

Also, upon taking a picture of it on my S24+ to leave this review, it automatically gave me option to pair(interesting). I hadn't had it on for long before the battery ran out but i can't comment on this because i do not know if it was fully charge(update later on this).The fit is also something I'll have to get used to as my ears are small(I loved the fit of the Buds+ better).

My window is right next to a main road in my town, and I can sit right in front of it, watching cars go by 15 feet away, without anything playing in the earbuds, and not hear the cars at all.

I was frankly expecting a similar outcome with these Buds 2 Pro, I was instead very surprised to find out that they fit and stay in my ears better than even the Buds FE and other wingtipped buds. I can wear them indefinitely without discomfort, and rarely have to adjust their position in my ears. I do not know how they pulled this off. They are noticeably lighter than previous buds, this surely plays a role.  (I understand the fitment will vary by individual)Battery life is also perfectly sufficient for most people's listening habits, I would imagine. The old Buds+ and their 11+ hours have spoiled me though, and leave me wanting more with all the Buds I've had since, but, I can't really complain with these specifically, ~6 hours is a fine tradeoff if it means lighter buds with better drivers.I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell you why these sound great, but they do, that is certain.HIGHLY recommend.",

From design to functionality, these earbuds have set a new standard for wireless audio, earning a solid five-star rating from me.Let's start with the design. Sleek and modern, these earbuds are not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The ergonomic design ensures a secure fit, whether I'm working out at the gym or running errands around town. Plus, the IPX8 waterproof rating provides peace of mind, knowing that they can withstand even the most intense sweat sessions or unexpected rain showers.But where these earbuds truly shine is in their performance. The Bluetooth 5.3 technology delivers a stable and seamless connection, allowing me to enjoy crystal-clear audio without any interruptions or lag. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlist or taking calls on the go, the sound quality is consistently impressive, with deep bass and crisp highs that rival even premium wired headphones.The touch controls are another standout feature, offering intuitive navigation with a simple tap or swipe. Adjusting the volume, skipping tracks, or answering calls has never been easier, thanks to the responsive touch sensors on each earbud. And with the included charging case, I can conveniently power up my earbuds on the go, ensuring they're always ready whenever I need them.Speaking of convenience, the battery life on these earbuds is exceptional.

        "review": "these are SO good. theyre my first budget wireless headphones and they honestly have better sound quality than my (admittedly pretty old) airpods. bought them to use in the shower and the water doesnt affect the performance at all. i obviously try not to get water right on them because i want them to last a while, not sure how they perform otherwise. they also are very noise canceling, i can hardly hear any outside noise when im using them even at a low volume.my only complaints are that theyre kind of weirdly shaped and take a lot of finagling to fit in my ear correctly and stay there, even with the different sized ear pieces that are included. also when it tells you to tap them to change the volume that hasnt worked for me, maybe im not doing it right or something, but that isnt a huge deal for me i dont have a problem just picking up my phone and changing the volume or pausing if i need to.overall these are super great especially for the price point and i would seriously recommend",

        "review": "I got these mostly so I could listen to music in the shower. They worked well and the aims quality was decent. But then I noticed the left earbud wasn't producing sound. When I had take it out of the case it didn't light up, so thought it may not have charged whole the right one did.After using, I made sure to firmly push both back into the charging case, and they both flashed.But the next few times the left one wasn't producing sound, but the touch control still worked; so i figured i must have water in my ear or something blocking the sound.After leaving them in the case overnight (case still showed 3 bars of power in the morning) i tried using them totally dry, and got the same results - the left one was not producing any sound, even though the touch control still worked.",

        "review": "I wanted to like these wireless earbuds, and while they do have some positives, the overall experience fell short especially when it comes to using the microphone.The earbuds fit in my ears comfortably and stay in place, even during light activity. The audio quality is decent for casual listening clear mids and highs but they definitely lack bass and any kind of immersive or surround sound feel, despite the product listing mentioning \"deep bass.\" If you\u2019re an audiophile or looking for rich sound, these may not cut it.The biggest issue, however, is with the microphone. It picks up every bit of background noise ambient sounds, people talking nearby, even quiet room noise. During calls, people constantly tell me they can barely hear or understand me over all the background chatter. It becomes nearly impossible to have a clear, focused conversation, which really defeats the purpose of using them for calls.If you're just using these for solo music listening or videos in a quiet setting, they might be okay. But if call quality and mic clarity are important to you, I\u2019d look elsewhere.",

        "review": "I upgraded to these after owning the Galaxy Buds Live, which is a very different design. I'm not an audiophile, but I am fairly experienced with mid-tier sound equipment, speakers, and headphones. I built my own 11.1 surround sound movie room using a higher end Yamaha receiver and have used Klipsch, Polk Audio, Paradigm, BIC America, Sony, Yamaha, Pioneer, Bose (don't judge me, they work well in some applications), JL Audio, JBL, Mirage, and other brands of speakers through the years in home and car audio setups. For headphones, I've mainly used wired as early wireless models sounded hollow and tinny in comparison. I've used lower end AKG and Sony buds, as well as mid-tier Sennheisers. I've also used higher end Sony over-ear headphones as well as the highly rated (but lesser known) Status Audio CB-1 studio monitor headphones.I waited a while to buy into the wireless headphone market and finally took the plunge with the Buds Live as they offered something my wired headphones didn't\u2014ambient sound. Usually this is an unwanted distraction and noise isolation is preferred, but sometimes I want to be aware of what's going on around me and be able to engage in a conversation even if I have my buds in. Apple did this well with their pass-through technology, but I'm not about to switch over to an entirely new product line and closed ecosystem just for headphones, so I waited. The Buds Live managed this trick with a low-tech solution by not sealing in the ear canal, so I gave them a try. Sound quality was decent\u2014on par with my lower end AKG wired buds, but not as good as my mid-tier (~$100) Sennheiser buds. They also were finnicky with their connection and cut out a lot if my phone was in my pocket, especially if I bent over or squatted.BUDS 2 PRO:I upgraded to these as they also had a pass-through feature which seemed to work fairly well and did so automatically when you started talking. I figured this would be just as good and offer better sound and isolation when desired. Overall I think this feature works pretty good and is a nice compromise for me. In terms of sound quality, the Buds 2 Pro are definitely a step up from the Buds Live and probably on par with my wired mid-tier Sennheisers. I can't complain about the sound quality at all.As with the Buds Live though, the Buds 2 Pro require a bit of fidgeting to get them seated in the ear properly. Traditional ear buds, and even Apple's Airpods require little thought or adjustment beyond getting the right sized rubber or foam tips for a good seal. Samsung seems to go for more experimental designs which require learning and getting used to. After a few days use, they still aren't \"natural\" to put in or locked into muscle memory\u2014I have to fuss with them a bit to get a good seal. Once in though, I haven't had any problems.Overall, I recommend these buds. They still aren't perfect as the fit isn't intuitive, battery life a little meager, and the noise cancellation is about 85-90%, not 100, but overall, solid headphones. Could you get way better sounding wired headphones for tons less money? Yes, for about $50 you can pick up a pair of Status CB-1's and hear every fine detail in high fidelity. But in the wireless in-ear category, prioritizing convenience and mobility over everything else, these perform admirably. I've heard Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3 buds *might* edge these out in terms of sound quality, but they look a lot more bulky (stick out more from the ear and therefore may be less stable) and don't have the automatic ambient sound pass-through feature. They also are a touch more money. On the upside though, they appear to be a more traditional bud design, so might be more straightforward to put in, but Airpods are probably still the easiest to put in and take out.But I plan on using the Buds 2 Pro for years before feeling the need to upgrade again. I'm satisfied with the purchase, though still wincing at the cost-to-performance ratio compared to wired options. Can't knock a product for performing in the top tier of its specific market though, so I'll give it 5 stars as a true wireless earbud, but would give it 4 in sound quality against cheaper wired in-ear and over-ear options.",

        "review": "I have had these for 3 yrs now.  I use them almost daily as a construction worker.  With no music playing it actually makes it easier to talk to people because the noise cancelling cuts out all the background noise.  I often wear them just as ear plugs with no audio at all.  They work better than foam plugs for grinding or other loud tasks.  If I have music playing on top of the noise canceling I basically cannot hear anything but the music and these sound great.  I was adverse to ear buds for a long time until I bought these.  I always preferred over ear headphones.  The \"jelly bean\" style is very nice and with 3 cup sizes in the box its easy to get a good fit.  They do have a poor battery life but it last long enough to get me to break and then they go in the car.  They charge fast so its no issue really and given how much work they are doing with the noise canceling its no surprise they are heavy on battery usage.  I do not use voice detect because I found that WILL kill your battery if you intend to use these for work all day.  The augmented audio feature is also very cool.  Nice for hunting.  I clean them cups and screens often with a q tip.  One soaked in peroxide and then one soaked in alcohol.  They have maintained great audio clarity over the years despite heavy use in the very tough environment of an outdoor construction site during all seasons in Michigan.  I'd buy a new set before I \"upgrade\" to the blade style of the buds pro 3.",

        "review": "I researched on this earbuds for a year when it came out but it was so expensive. Then this year I saw that it's on installment and discounted. It even got more affordable this month, wish I waited longer. I love this because I have the Z Fold 5, been a phablet x stylus user since Note 2! There are so many reasons to invest in this earbuds, most especially if you're a Samsung user.First, it just integrates with my phone intuitively and I can use it with my MacBook 2017 and Garmin Fenix 6s! The Wearable widget helps reconnect the earbuds back to the phone faster than fumbling with the app. I can continue listening to a song or podcast on Spotify from my phone to my laptop and back to my phone, and the sound quality and volume doesn't change.Second, the connectivity is sustained better than other wireless earbuds, whether watching a video, listening, or gaming! There's a gaming option that minimizes the lag between the sound and game action. I can leave my phone farther and still listen to music, or more important, get calls while doing tasks more than 20 feet or more away - even between 2 rooms apart. I had cheaper buds that once I close our steel-cored front door, the connection with my phone will be disrupted even if my phone is just right next to the door.Third, I love the responsiveness to equalizer adjustments! I'm not a sound engineer or audiophile but I used their reviews to narrow down my options based on the products that produce the best sound qualities on the range of frequencies I can already hear with my naked ears. We appreciate sounds differently so it depends on individual hearing but we'd agree that these pricey things respond fast! My hearing was tested, I'm also trained in classical music, and have a healthcare background, so my ears seek refined details from music or physiological sounds. I don't like too much enhanced bass and uncomfortable loudness, as those can lead to deafness. These buds can be loud and bass-proud too! Fresh from the box, these buds were on Normal settings on the Wearable equalizer. To me, I heard the lower frequencies more than the higher ones but I can still distinctly appreciate the higher registers. So I tweaked the equalizer and it responds immediately!!! That equalizer doesn't allow customization but Spotify allows it. I noticed that the Dynamic option looks like the Harman Curve, whether you're a fan of it or not, it's preset already. Although with these earbuds, I can tell if music has been rendered with Dolby, HiFi or some technology... some music do sound unnatural. I had to check the music piece I'm studying if I heard the musical dynamics right, as I might be attempting to produce that sound quality in real life.Now, the stuff I don't like... first, these were so uncomfortable at the start. I can't bear these in my ears for 30 minutes when I first got it. I had to stretch my earlobes and wear these for staggered periods of time per day. I mixed and matched between small and mid-sized tips until the buds fit test say they're ok and it does feel comfortable. It took me a week to adjust my ears and now I can wear them 4 to 6 hours straight. I almost returned these but I thought I'm used to having wired earphones and it's the sacrifice to wireless earbuds that do work. Just like others advice, do the fit test frequently until the fit feels right.Second, the charging case isn't waterproof and shockproof, so I bought the Samsung armor for it. Both the buds and case get dusty pretty quickly. I clean the tips and case with alcohol and tissue.Third, I don't like that it's protruding out of my earlobes but it is what it is. As of this writing, it's one of the smaller and lighter earbuds. I've tried working out and doing sports with these, they pop out when I clench my jaw, move my head in many directions or jump. I have to strap these so if it does pop out, it'll hang from my shoulders and not get stepped on.Oh well, enjoy yours!",
