        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

I\u2019ve only had to charge them twice in 4 months. They sound really good with the adaptive noise cancellation and custom equalizer. The microphone quality could be better, but the value for price is INSANE. The different sized tips fit any ear and the functionality it overall the best I\u2019ve seen.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

The sound quality is fantastic, the bass is punchy and powerful without drowning out the mids and highs.

However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.

It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.

They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200).

The sound quality is also surprisingly acceptable.I have not had these on long enough to test out battery life or what not. I use this for workouts, so no more than an hr or so of actual use a day.I hate the touch controls, so had to turn it off using the app. Thankfully they let you turn all of the touch controls via the app, plus turn off the noise\\ping you hear when you brush up against the touch control....So this is as basic of use as you can get, which I look for in headphones.I am sick of haptic controls, touch controls, over-reliance of the accompanying app, and active noise cancelling features. All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage.

        "review": "This is my second pair of Sound Core earbuds. My first set lasted me for several years and I still use them, but thought I would have a second pair on hand just in case they fail. They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

Bluetooth connectivity is smooth, and the added translation feature is a great bonus.For the price, the quality is outstanding\u2014easily one of the best values I\u2019ve experienced in wireless earbuds.

It takes a lot these days for a purchase to genuinely blow me away, especially in the age of the countless low priced, questionable quality \u201caudiophile grade\u201d true wireless options out there. I have a pair on Sennheisser HD660s and Grado sr80s powered through a Fiios K5 Pro for at home listening. I needed something for the gym, being out and about, and most importantly travel.THESE THINGS ARE THE BEST TRUE WIRELESS EAR BUDS I HAVE EVER USED. Greatly prefer these to AirPods. I was expecting just a decent sounding pair of Bluetooth earbuds and had proper expectations for the super low price of these. What I got is something that has to be experienced to convey just how awesome these things are.Quick Pros/Things That Jumped Out-Extremely comfortable fit with a wide range of sizes for every ear canal > the App literally will run a test to check if you have a proper seal to ensure the best sound-THE APP! This is what has blown me away the most. This thing is BEAUTIFULLY designed and has some of the coolest features I have ever seen implemented in Bluetooth headphones:-running a hearing test to tell each separate ear\u2019s overall health when it comes to noise exposure and being able to pick up frequencies-Ability to toggle between different modes(music, spatial, movie, games)-Ability to adjust the degree of active noise cancellation, including different modes such as adaptive which will automatically adjust, being able to amplify sounds coming from a TV in the background for example, being able to have a conversation without pausing your music-THE EQ IS SO IMPRESSIVE. It runs a series of A B tests to determine your distinct sound preferences to multiple variations of the same song where you choose if either A or B sounds better.-Connection is effortless, the buttons are not only easy to actually use on the ear buds, but they are fully customizable-COMFORT. I have been wearing these for 5 hours now and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I don\u2019t even notice them. Haven\u2019t had to take them out a single time to let my \u201cears breathe\u201d-Super durable build. Was surprised by the heft of the case and buds themselves-MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL- The sound quality is simply unparalleled as far as Bluetooth buds go. I would buy these for $200 without question. The EQ makes it so no matter your preference, you can tweak the sound to exactly how you like it. The fidelity, clarity, bass, highs, vocals, etc all shine.This is one of the best purchases I have made in years and could not be more pleased",

More refined sound quality, a giant leap in Noise Cancellation,  ergonomics of tapping have improved significantly, connection speed...basically in every respect a vast improvement. Definitely worth the upgrade, especially for the incredibly cheap price they are being offered for.I give them 4 stars though for one reason: The darned case. It's horrible. Soundcore must have put together a design group with the challenge to create the worst possible case for these otherwise brilliant earphones. The surface is slippery like a small bar of wet soap. The case is jet black and top and bottom are exactly the same other than a microscopic and virtually invisible Soundcore logo on top. The catch to open it is also very small and uncomfortable so the soap case can slip out of your hands. I had to paint a big white dot on the top left hand corner to orient myself and use extreme caution every time I open the case. A shame for what are otherwise such brilliant earphones.",

It runs a series of A B tests to determine your distinct sound preferences to multiple variations of the same song where you choose if either A or B sounds better.-Connection is effortless, the buttons are not only easy to actually use on the ear buds, but they are fully customizable-COMFORT.

        "review": "I own a pair of Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which I absolutely love for their amazing noise-canceling feature. They completely block out airplane noise \u2014 even when I\u2019m seated right next to the wing \u2014 and are my go-to travel companion. However, once I started working out regularly, I quickly realized that my Bose earbuds weren\u2019t ideal for the gym. They constantly fell out during strength training, and I got tired of picking them up off the floor mid-set.So I decided to try the Powerbeats Pro, which are heavily marketed for athletes. While they did stay securely on my ears during workouts, I was disappointed by the lack of noise cancellation. Despite the claims, there was virtually no difference between the noise-canceling and transparency modes, and for the price (nearly $300!), that was a huge letdown.After doing more research, I came across the Soundcore Sport earbuds. I already use several Anker products and have been happy with their quality, so while I was initially skeptical due to the lower price point, I decided to give it a try.First off, these earbuds have their own app \u2014 something the Powerbeats Pro didn\u2019t. The app lets you customize sound modes, adjust bass, and fine-tune audio settings to your liking. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, on par with much more expensive earbuds. I tested them while walking around my neighborhood and during peak hours at the gym. I could barely hear people grunting or chatting nearby (which is one of my biggest gym pet peeves!).They also stay perfectly in place during strength training, which was my top priority. Combined with the excellent noise cancellation, these quickly became my new favorite pair of workout earbuds. I happily returned my Powerbeats Pro the very next day.If you\u2019re looking for comfortable, secure earbuds with real noise cancellation and great sound quality at a reasonable price, these are a fantastic choice. You get premium features without the premium price tag \u2014 truly a great value and a solid purchase.",

It seems to have lost the ability to read the case/charger's charge level, but the light on the case still works for that purpose. Equalizer sometimes gets overwhelmed and won't switch settings. You get better battery life if you minimize use of app features and rely on the sound's source device for digital signal processing. Programmable control buttons is a pretty handy feature for me, but the buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. Reproduces Dolby Atmos immersive sound fairly decently.

I had some Jabra Elite 8 Actives before this but had trouble keeping them in my ear during workouts. These stay in place and were less than half the price! I also love how much smoother and faster they connect to multiple Bluetooth sources. When I\u2019m working they\u2019re typically connected to both my iPhone and my laptop. When a call comes in on Teams or Jabber on my laptop, the music from my iPhone automatically pauses and allows me to take the call. My previous headphones didn\u2019t work well in these situations.Good sound cancelling. Haven\u2019t tried them while mowing yet.The only problems I\u2019ve experienced are that 1) they occasionally drop the connection from my laptop in the middle of a long call and 2) when taking a call on Teams sometimes the ringing continues in my headphones after I\u2019ve answered the call. (In that case, I hear both the person on the line and the ringing for ~5-10 seconds before the ringing stops.) Not sure if the root of these problems is the laptop (& its software) or the headphones. It\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s the laptop. Regardless, these issues are occasional enough that I still am happy with the purchase.Great battery life! I charge mine ~2x a week for the 2-3 hrs I use them each day. Case is secure and the headphones seat easily to charge.One final positive - I had trouble with the microphone noise cancelling on my previous headphones when taking calls in the car. In other words, people on the other end couldn\u2019t hear me easily. I drive an older truck thats somewhat loud, but these headphones have no problem cancelling out the background noise and allowing the person on the other end to hear me.

        "review": "I own a pair of Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which I absolutely love for their amazing noise-canceling feature. They completely block out airplane noise \u2014 even when I\u2019m seated right next to the wing \u2014 and are my go-to travel companion. However, once I started working out regularly, I quickly realized that my Bose earbuds weren\u2019t ideal for the gym. They constantly fell out during strength training, and I got tired of picking them up off the floor mid-set.So I decided to try the Powerbeats Pro, which are heavily marketed for athletes. While they did stay securely on my ears during workouts, I was disappointed by the lack of noise cancellation. Despite the claims, there was virtually no difference between the noise-canceling and transparency modes, and for the price (nearly $300!), that was a huge letdown.After doing more research, I came across the Soundcore Sport earbuds. I already use several Anker products and have been happy with their quality, so while I was initially skeptical due to the lower price point, I decided to give it a try.First off, these earbuds have their own app \u2014 something the Powerbeats Pro didn\u2019t. The app lets you customize sound modes, adjust bass, and fine-tune audio settings to your liking. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, on par with much more expensive earbuds. I tested them while walking around my neighborhood and during peak hours at the gym. I could barely hear people grunting or chatting nearby (which is one of my biggest gym pet peeves!).They also stay perfectly in place during strength training, which was my top priority. Combined with the excellent noise cancellation, these quickly became my new favorite pair of workout earbuds. I happily returned my Powerbeats Pro the very next day.If you\u2019re looking for comfortable, secure earbuds with real noise cancellation and great sound quality at a reasonable price, these are a fantastic choice. You get premium features without the premium price tag \u2014 truly a great value and a solid purchase.",

It seems to have lost the ability to read the case/charger's charge level, but the light on the case still works for that purpose. Equalizer sometimes gets overwhelmed and won't switch settings. You get better battery life if you minimize use of app features and rely on the sound's source device for digital signal processing. Programmable control buttons is a pretty handy feature for me, but the buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. Reproduces Dolby Atmos immersive sound fairly decently. Fit in ears VERY WELL AND SNUG WITH NO COMFORT PROBLEMS. This simply cannot be overstated. Transparent and active noise canceling modes are nice.

I had some Jabra Elite 8 Actives before this but had trouble keeping them in my ear during workouts. These stay in place and were less than half the price! I also love how much smoother and faster they connect to multiple Bluetooth sources. When I\u2019m working they\u2019re typically connected to both my iPhone and my laptop. When a call comes in on Teams or Jabber on my laptop, the music from my iPhone automatically pauses and allows me to take the call. My previous headphones didn\u2019t work well in these situations.Good sound cancelling. Haven\u2019t tried them while mowing yet.The only problems I\u2019ve experienced are that 1) they occasionally drop the connection from my laptop in the middle of a long call and 2) when taking a call on Teams sometimes the ringing continues in my headphones after I\u2019ve answered the call. (In that case, I hear both the person on the line and the ringing for ~5-10 seconds before the ringing stops.) Not sure if the root of these problems is the laptop (& its software) or the headphones. It\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s the laptop. Regardless, these issues are occasional enough that I still am happy with the purchase.Great battery life! I charge mine ~2x a week for the 2-3 hrs I use them each day. Case is secure and the headphones seat easily to charge.One final positive - I had trouble with the microphone noise cancelling on my previous headphones when taking calls in the car. In other words, people on the other end couldn\u2019t hear me easily. I drive an older truck thats somewhat loud, but these headphones have no problem cancelling out the background noise and allowing the person on the other end to hear me. (And yes, I\u2019ve asked them!)Overall, an excellent value. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a single pair of headphones for work, working out, and taking calls in the car.",

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

        "review": "I have tested many earbuds and for the price I\u2019d consider these better than any wireless earbuds on the market like AirPods, skullcandy, and Bose. I\u2019ve only had to charge them twice in 4 months. They sound really good with the adaptive noise cancellation and custom equalizer. The microphone quality could be better, but the value for price is INSANE. The different sized tips fit any ear and the functionality it overall the best I\u2019ve seen.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

        "review": "The Soundcore P30i by Anker are pretty solid for what they cost. The sound quality is clear, and they stay comfortable even after wearing them for a while. They connect fast and the battery life is actually better than I expected.My only real complaint is the volume control you can\u2019t turn it up quickly, and it takes a few taps to get it where you want it. Not a dealbreaker, just annoying when you\u2019re trying to adjust on the fly.Other than that, they work exactly how you\u2019d hope budget earbuds would. For the price, they get the job done and sound good doing it.",

        "review": "I ordered these to have a reliable pair of noise-cancelling earbuds, and I am honestly blown away by the value. The sound quality is fantastic, the bass is punchy and powerful without drowning out the mids and highs. The noise cancellation works surprisingly well for this price point, blocking out a good amount of background noise when I'm working or commuting.One of my favorite features is actually the charging case. The built-in phone stand design is such a clever touch; it\u2019s super handy for watching videos on my phone while I'm eating or traveling.The battery life is excellent (I haven't had to charge the case in days), and they are comfortable enough to wear for long sessions. If you want great sound and a functional design without breaking the bank, these are a solid choice.",

The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I\u2019m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore\u2019s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I\u2019m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I\u2019m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple\u2019s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple\u2019s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I\u2019ve accepted that earbuds in general just won\u2019t last forever with daily use, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I\u2019m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore\u2019s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",

        "review": "I got these as a lower-cost replacement for the 1st generation AirPods Pro that I had used for a few years (before one of the pods finally met its unfortunate demise), and I\u2019d say they\u2019re just about as good all-around as those were. The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I\u2019m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore\u2019s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I\u2019m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I\u2019m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple\u2019s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple\u2019s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I\u2019ve accepted that earbuds in general just won\u2019t last forever with daily use, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I\u2019m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore\u2019s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",

        "review": "So I have been a huge audiophile my entire life driven with rhythm and sound of nature and creation. I have tried many audio devices and have never quite had the experience that I've been able to receive from soundcore audio. I have purchased the p20, p3i, p40i's twice (one for me and my wife), I also have the space q45, I also recently purchased and reviewed the Aero Fit pro.As far as the p40i they fit a lot differently than the p3is. I personally had issues keeping them in my ears without them falling out which led to their demise in a toilet. However while I had them their voice quality seemed unmatched. Posting the capacity for six mics not only does the noise canceling work amazingly. Near comparable to the q45s capacity. The sound distribution is fantastic providing a deep into you sound.  Touch base control makes it interesting and easy to trigger. In my opinion they are not set up for movement like sports or other physical activities. Connectivity, functionality, battery life and volume control function flawlessly. And overall clarity and value for money they offer a little more than the cheaper variety.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality.

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

The battery life is also astonishing. They fit perfectly in my ears, and very comfortably. I love the color options they have available. You can customize your sound and the controls on their app. Only complaint is that they don\u2019t have ANC, although in my experience my music already cancelled everything out.",

I also have four sets of Apple earbuds that are pretty much worthless.  Each set has one nonworking earbud and the other earbud doesn't keep a good charge.  Soundcore earbuds are comfortable as I wear them in bed listening to Audible.",

My wife has a set of wireless earbuds from that \u201cfruit\u201d company and these blow those completely out of the water and for a fraction of the price.The are extremely clear and have great bass. The batteries on the earpieces and the case last longer than you\u2019d think as well. The controls on the earpieces are very functional and I found them incredibly useful after I figured them out.Before you go out and spend big on earbuds, give these a try!",

        "review": "Let me start out by saying that this is a very solid/compelling product in this price range.  The Liberty 4 NC's do a lot of things well for it's price point.  The Noise Cancelling for it's time was among the best(better than the Earfun Air Pro 4 in my experience) in class, the sound quality is decent out of the box(they offer EQ via the app if you want to tune it), battery life is superb(I can use it for hours in a single session), and the build quality is decent.I believe for it's price segment (varies throughout, but I'll pick the price point of say $60-70), it's a very strong contender and you can't go wrong with this product for the right price.However, I do have 2 qualms.. one of them is specific to me though so your mileage may vary:First, the fitting.. the shape of the earpiece does not fit my ear too well, I do not have large ears per-se, but I use the largest ear tips in order to get a better seal.  Not only do I have issues with getting a proper seal in my ear canal, but they also don't seat well in my ear, as they tend to fall out more easily.  I don't seem to have this issue with some other earbuds(like the Earfun Air Pro 4), but I do have this issue with the Liberty 4 NC's.  I will say that it's not necessarily a deal breaker though, just an annoyance, something to watch out for as it depends on your ears.Second qualm is the mic performance is just mediocre, though it is adequate for it's price class.I don't use transparency mode very often, but they seem to work ok.  I'm glad that these have a transparency mode at least.---I also wanted to note, as I alluded to earlier, that I have both the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC and the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.  I have tested both of these in a noisy cafe, and the Liberty 4 NC's noise cancelling is noticeably superior to the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  So depending on your priorities, I'd still say overall, I prefer the Liberty 4 NC's.",

        "review": "I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.  My wife called me when I was out while using the earfuns and she said I sounded fine.  I have not used these so far to talk on the phone while I ride so I cannot speak to that.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation on the Liberty\u2019s is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.Not knocking any of these, just trying to give an honest opinion to those who are debating  price/quality",

The Noise Cancelling for it's time was among the best(better than the Earfun Air Pro 4 in my experience) in class, the sound quality is decent out of the box(they offer EQ via the app if you want to tune it), battery life is superb(I can use it for hours in a single session), and the build quality is decent.I believe for it's price segment (varies throughout, but I'll pick the price point of say $60-70), it's a very strong contender and you can't go wrong with this product for the right price.However, I do have 2 qualms.. one of them is specific to me though so your mileage may vary:First, the fitting.. the shape of the earpiece does not fit my ear too well, I do not have large ears per-se, but I use the largest ear tips in order to get a better seal.  Not only do I have issues with getting a proper seal in my ear canal, but they also don't seat well in my ear, as they tend to fall out more easily.  I don't seem to have this issue with some other earbuds(like the Earfun Air Pro 4), but I do have this issue with the Liberty 4 NC's.  I will say that it's not necessarily a deal breaker though, just an annoyance, something to watch out for as it depends on your ears.Second qualm is the mic performance is just mediocre, though it is adequate for it's price class.I don't use transparency mode very often, but they seem to work ok.  I'm glad that these have a transparency mode at least.---I also wanted to note, as I alluded to earlier, that I have both the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC and the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.  I have tested both of these in a noisy cafe, and the Liberty 4 NC's noise cancelling is noticeably superior to the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  So depending on your priorities, I'd still say overall, I prefer the Liberty 4 NC's.",

        "review": "I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.  My wife called me when I was out while using the earfuns and she said I sounded fine.  I have not used these so far to talk on the phone while I ride so I cannot speak to that.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation on the Liberty\u2019s is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.Not knocking any of these, just trying to give an honest opinion to those who are debating  price/quality",

        "review": "I've been using these since March 2025. I normally am not a fan of earbuds, I find them uncomfortable to wear after more than 30 minutes. However I ordered memory foam earpads has the ear pads that come with this headset didn't quite fit. With that one small $5 purchase of memory foam ear pads these earbuds turned out to be amazing. They have excellent noise canceling property, they are extremely comfortable to wear for hours at a time and I even forget I have them inserted.Sound quality is amazing, I'm a big fan of hearing bass when I listen to music and these do not disappoint. You can download an app for your phone to use them which is optional, but by downloading the app you can utilize a fit test to see how well the noise canceling is working.Telephone calls, no problem with the listener hearing me and vice versa.Not that it matters but the aesthetic is excellent because I like blue and I chose that model color.Battery life is highly impressive, once you charge the case you can use it for multiple recharges to the earbuds before you have to recharge the case. A bonus is that the case will work on a wireless charger and a wired charger depending on what you prefer to use.Overall, the price point is amazing considering that these are not some of the top of the line models that you may have heard about yet these perform at top of the line. I see no reason to purchase name brand earbuds for something that does the job if not exceeds the ones that are at the top of the line.",

        "review": "I am a serious music listener, and own many top-tier IEMs. My experience has always been that wireless IEMs are far inferior to wired. I purchased the Liberty 4 Pro as a replacement for my AKG N400 TWS set, which have gone kaput. I bought the Liberty 4 Pro on sale for $89, so I expected them to be functional, but not exceptional. My mistake.While these don't rival my best sets, they are a tremendous performance/price set. On a scale of 1-10, where my top set (ISN Audio EST80) is a 9, these are a solid 6.5. That's huge. My old AKGs were a 4 at best. Everything about the Liberty Pro is amazing. The sound is wonderful, really. But it's the sophistication of the electronics that makes them really shine. Let's talk about that.The case is excellent and charges the IEMs rapidly. One word of caution - if you change the eartips to a non-OEM pair, be certain they fit the case properly, or your IEMs may not charge. Onward --The app is where all the stuff happens. There are hearing tests to help you design a custom EQ profile along with 22 built-in EQ profiles. If there isn't one there that tweaks these IEMs to you liking, check your hearing. These are all well designed, and very effective. There are so many options to customize your listening experience.

However I ordered memory foam earpads has the ear pads that come with this headset didn't quite fit. With that one small $5 purchase of memory foam ear pads these earbuds turned out to be amazing. They have excellent noise canceling property, they are extremely comfortable to wear for hours at a time and I even forget I have them inserted.Sound quality is amazing, I'm a big fan of hearing bass when I listen to music and these do not disappoint. You can download an app for your phone to use them which is optional, but by downloading the app you can utilize a fit test to see how well the noise canceling is working.Telephone calls, no problem with the listener hearing me and vice versa.Not that it matters but the aesthetic is excellent because I like blue and I chose that model color.Battery life is highly impressive, once you charge the case you can use it for multiple recharges to the earbuds before you have to recharge the case. A bonus is that the case will work on a wireless charger and a wired charger depending on what you prefer to use.Overall, the price point is amazing considering that these are not some of the top of the line models that you may have heard about yet these perform at top of the line. I see no reason to purchase name brand earbuds for something that does the job if not exceeds the ones that are at the top of the line.",

I purchased the Liberty 4 Pro as a replacement for my AKG N400 TWS set, which have gone kaput. I bought the Liberty 4 Pro on sale for $89, so I expected them to be functional, but not exceptional. My mistake.While these don't rival my best sets, they are a tremendous performance/price set. On a scale of 1-10, where my top set (ISN Audio EST80) is a 9, these are a solid 6.5. That's huge. My old AKGs were a 4 at best. Everything about the Liberty Pro is amazing. The sound is wonderful, really. But it's the sophistication of the electronics that makes them really shine. Let's talk about that.The case is excellent and charges the IEMs rapidly. One word of caution - if you change the eartips to a non-OEM pair, be certain they fit the case properly, or your IEMs may not charge. Onward --The app is where all the stuff happens. There are hearing tests to help you design a custom EQ profile along with 22 built-in EQ profiles. If there isn't one there that tweaks these IEMs to you liking, check your hearing.

My only complaint is that I did not find the ANC to be very effective compared with the Apple AirPods 4 ANC.The Apple ANC is amazing, especially considering they are also open earbud design. The Apple ANC does not eliminate the background noise, but significantly lowers the volume on background noise. The effect of the ANC on the Liberty Buds was better than nothing, but significantly less effective than the Apple ANC.Whether or not comparing these Liberty Buds to the AirPods 4 ANC is fair or not depends on the price. This Christmas, the AirPods 4 ANC were widely available for $99. However, normally the Apple Air Pods 4 ANC are nearly twice the price of the Libery Buds. Thus, the fair comparison may be against the Apple AirPods with no ANC to the Liberty Buds with minimal ANC. In this case, some ANC is better than none and the Liberty Buds offer better fit and better controls. The only other issue is whether you are part of the Apple ecosystem.Although marginally improved, I still hate the way that Apple AirPods fall out of my ears. The Liberty Buds are very secure, yet very comfortable. I have fallen asleep and still had them in my ear. I also like the ability to customize the controls as well as the ability to have one of those controls set to control the volume on the buds.

        "review": "I own a number of SoundCore products including A20 and A30 sleep buds and I've had extensive experience with both the tech and customer service sides of Anker's business. While I'm used to in-ear buds I hoped that the design of the Liberty buds would be less likely to irritate the inside of my ears while still delivering decent sound. The idea would be to have buds that can function well in different environments including the gym while not being stuck inside the user's ear canal. Here's my quick review:-The sound quality is quite good and actually better than I expected. The quality if very good, connectivity no problem and the range of the buds from the app on your phone is better than either Bose or Apple. As with other SoundCore products the app is pretty intuitive and the number of features is excellent. It's apparent that Anker is focused on constant updates of their software and actually listens to customer feedback to their engineers.-Part of the attraction to the buds was the language translation feature and with limited use I found that the translation delay does work pretty well with minimal delay. It's clear that Anker is working to become competitive with Apple and Bose at a lower cost for this feature.-Now for the deal breaker (at least for me). The other SoundCore buds have a very good design that uses different size \"fins\" to fit inside the interior of your ear while not being \"inside\" your ear canal. I've had very good luck with both the A20 and A30 sleep buds fit and expected the fin design of the Liberty buds to be similar. Nope, not so much.  The fin design is much different and despite a few days of trying to find the right fin and trying to insert the bud correctly in my ear I realized that the Liberty buds were simply not for me or my ear design and both the comfort and sound quality are both negatively affected by how loose the buds are inside the user's ear. In addition, unless the fit is 100% right the feeling is that the buds will fall out.-I'm not sure why SoundCore chose to use this design or what the overall use profile is (for me certainly not the gym or on the bike) but that is certainly because of the fit issue for me. While SoundCore's customer service is excellent there's really no way that they can help fine tune fit over the phone or online. Perhaps my expectations and use profile don't fit the Liberty buds but because of my previous SoundCore experience I hoped for a better design. I'll have to stick with my old Bose Sport Buds for the time being.",

        "review": "I own a number of SoundCore products including A20 and A30 sleep buds and I've had extensive experience with both the tech and customer service sides of Anker's business. While I'm used to in-ear buds I hoped that the design of the Liberty buds would be less likely to irritate the inside of my ears while still delivering decent sound. The idea would be to have buds that can function well in different environments including the gym while not being stuck inside the user's ear canal. Here's my quick review:-The sound quality is quite good and actually better than I expected. The quality if very good, connectivity no problem and the range of the buds from the app on your phone is better than either Bose or Apple. As with other SoundCore products the app is pretty intuitive and the number of features is excellent. It's apparent that Anker is focused on constant updates of their software and actually listens to customer feedback to their engineers.-Part of the attraction to the buds was the language translation feature and with limited use I found that the translation delay does work pretty well with minimal delay. It's clear that Anker is working to become competitive with Apple and Bose at a lower cost for this feature.-Now for the deal breaker (at least for me). The other SoundCore buds have a very good design that uses different size \"fins\" to fit inside the interior of your ear while not being \"inside\" your ear canal. I've had very good luck with both the A20 and A30 sleep buds fit and expected the fin design of the Liberty buds to be similar. Nope, not so much.  The fin design is much different and despite a few days of trying to find the right fin and trying to insert the bud correctly in my ear I realized that the Liberty buds were simply not for me or my ear design and both the comfort and sound quality are both negatively affected by how loose the buds are inside the user's ear. In addition, unless the fit is 100% right the feeling is that the buds will fall out.-I'm not sure why SoundCore chose to use this design or what the overall use profile is (for me certainly not the gym or on the bike) but that is certainly because of the fit issue for me. While SoundCore's customer service is excellent there's really no way that they can help fine tune fit over the phone or online. Perhaps my expectations and use profile don't fit the Liberty buds but because of my previous SoundCore experience I hoped for a better design.

        "review": "Soundcore (a division of Anker Tech along with Eufy) has become my go to reliable source for fairly priced, great sounding, well-designed audio equipment, and these Liberty Buds are no exception. The fin designed to hold each bud in the ears works perfectly for me using the default medium size. I'm trying to use buds that are not \"in ear\" to help protect my hearing and these accomplish that while still sounding great. The noise cancelling is good at best, but because these are neither over nor fully in the ear, I wasn't expecting more. Sound is very good, especially bass response given the design, with the mids well represented and treble sweet and without sibilance. At the introductory 20 off price these are a no brainer, and even at full price they're easy to recommend.For millions of people, Anker has become synonymous with quality, feature rich, stylish products and an excellent price point. The Liberty Buds continue that trend and are a welcome addition to the family.",

        "review": "Short version. These are great if you like open earbuds, as I do. The sound is great, they are comfortable, and unlike the Apple AirPods which still fall out of my ears frequently, the Liberty Buds offer a very secure fit. My only complaint is that I did not find the ANC to be very effective compared with the Apple AirPods 4 ANC.The Apple ANC is amazing, especially considering they are also open earbud design. The Apple ANC does not eliminate the background noise, but significantly lowers the volume on background noise. The effect of the ANC on the Liberty Buds was better than nothing, but significantly less effective than the Apple ANC.Whether or not comparing these Liberty Buds to the AirPods 4 ANC is fair or not depends on the price. This Christmas, the AirPods 4 ANC were widely available for $99. However, normally the Apple Air Pods 4 ANC are nearly twice the price of the Libery Buds. Thus, the fair comparison may be against the Apple AirPods with no ANC to the Liberty Buds with minimal ANC. In this case, some ANC is better than none and the Liberty Buds offer better fit and better controls. The only other issue is whether you are part of the Apple ecosystem.Although marginally improved, I still hate the way that Apple AirPods fall out of my ears. The Liberty Buds are very secure, yet very comfortable. I have fallen asleep and still had them in my ear. I also like the ability to customize the controls as well as the ability to have one of those controls set to control the volume on the buds. Compared to my previous Soundcore products, I love the ear detection. I can pause whatever is playing by simply pulling a bud out of my ear. Great for when you need to listen or talk.",

I do not know why the ear wings aren't on all earbuds, they are so comfortable and clearly keep them from falling out of your ear, which is my biggest nuisance with a lot of them, as you start to feel it sliding out. These fit perfect, can't fall out. Now onto the sound.....the bass on these are so gooood! The overall sound quality for these earbuds are amazing. When I use these I don't feel I am missing out in comparison to over the head headphones. I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",

        "review": "First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels \"cheap\" or \"flimsy\". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a \"Soundcore Signature BassUp\". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",

It has an equalizer that you can utilize to adjust the audio to your own preference - which I personally haven\u2019t had to use, as I actually find the audio out of the box really balanced - and you can also actually reprogram the gestures to pause/play/etc to your liking if you don\u2019t like how they come.

        "review": "Battery life is longer than 9 hours. I got them at 630pm charged em for maybe n hour put em on around 730ish and fell asleep with em in and they were at 10% at 10am the next morning. I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the \"soundcore buds battery at 10%\" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Update Sept. 2025 5months later.Everything above still applies. Both buds still work and I way overwork these things. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have an earbud in more in a 24 hour period then I do not my wife constantly tells me how horrible it is for my ears to wear them and fall asleep with them in the way I do lol and I only charge them once a day, I could probably go once every 2 days if I forgot to charge them once but I choose to charge the case fully for work at night and I've never had the charging case even blink red. They're literally working all day and I switch them back and forth. Not a glitch or anything and the battery life is still top notch and sound quality has not dipped at all. I'm even more baffled that I use them the way I do and they still work like new 5 months later. I actually came here to buy another pair so I can leave a pair at work and one at home so I'm not using one pair to death the way I currently do. Buy em. I have a buddy who has the 10mm driver's and they're not as good as these. If your doom scrolling through Amazon looking for the right ones I'm telling you try these. It's barely $20 if you don't like em you only spent $20 but I'm 100% honest with my review and highly recommend buying these.Your welcome",

I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the \"soundcore buds battery at 10%\" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Update Sept. 2025 5months later.Everything above still applies. Both buds still work and I way overwork these things. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have an earbud in more in a 24 hour period then I do not my wife constantly tells me how horrible it is for my ears to wear them and fall asleep with them in the way I do lol and I only charge them once a day, I could probably go once every 2 days if I forgot to charge them once but I choose to charge the case fully for work at night and I've never had the charging case even blink red. They're literally working all day and I switch them back and forth. Not a glitch or anything and the battery life is still top notch and sound quality has not dipped at all. I'm even more baffled that I use them the way I do and they still work like new 5 months later. I actually came here to buy another pair so I can leave a pair at work and one at home so I'm not using one pair to death the way I currently do. Buy em. I have a buddy who has the 10mm driver's and they're not as good as these. If your doom scrolling through Amazon looking for the right ones I'm telling you try these. It's barely $20 if you don't like em you only spent $20 but I'm 100% honest with my review and highly recommend buying these.Your welcome",

They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200).

        "review": "Full disclosure - I have smaller ears and canals, and I am a side sleeper and I have been using these for the last 7 days.I am moving to a new town and decided to rent an apartment for a year to help me decide where to buy a house.  Well, the apartment walls and floors are not well insulated.  I hear footsteps, creaking floors, snoring through the wall, and sometimes can hear the tv shows they watch.  Needless to say, I was having serious trouble sleeping.  I could fall asleep pretty well (go to bed early), but I would be awakened at some point, or several points, in the night by all these noises, banging, walking, creaking, and snoring and was not able to get back to sleep.  I needed something to help.I tried Mack's foam ear plugs.  They work pretty good for noise reduction, but my ears would hurt and throb making my sleep difficult in that way.  I even had the small ears size.  They were comfortable to side sleep with.I bought some fake Loop alternatives as just ear plugs.  They were comfortable, did not throb like the Mack's in my ears, but did not block out enough sound.  When I tried a bigger ear plug piece, I found the throbbing ear syndrome again.  These were comfortable to side sleep with though.I then bought a cheap knock off brand of \"sleep buds\".  They were the most comfortable thus far.  They would bluetooth to my phone so I could play either music or some white noise from my phone.  They claimed to have ANC.  They were helpful to block out some sound because of the ear fit, and because they could bluetooth to my phone for music or white noise.  However, with the ANC on or off, I did not detect any difference in sound reduction.  These were kidney bean shaped sleep buds and did not stick out much from my ear.  The ear plug piece was comfortable, but the harder plastic part would start to be annoying after a few hours when on my side.  They were ok.  Sound quality was decent. Maybe a C+ for an overall grade for these.  However, they didn't stop all the sounds and I still woke up occasionally.I hesitantly tried the A30's.  This is no small investment! With the rubbery ear plug piece and ear fin, these buds were comfortable.  While on my side, they have been the most comfortable thus far.  I can sleep well with them in actually.  I still have a little bit of pressure while on my side, but some nifty pillow management helped relieve the pressure.  I am using the attachments they came with out of the box. I really like the white noise sounds.  I have Still Lake as my favorite.  It is a sutble sound that helps my brain drift off.  With the fit of the A30 alone, I can block out most of the noise for the night with these standard size pieces without using ANC.  Last night, I had both my wife snoring and banging on the ceiling above.  (To be honest, my wife's snoring is not super loud but enough to wake me up). Then I realized I didn't have the ANC on.  Well, i turned the ANC on and WOW what a difference.  It was almost like I had over the ear headphones with ANC on.  All that noise disappeared.  I was very impressed, at least I recall being impressed.  I was asleep!!The sound quality is perfect for night time sleeping.  In reading other reviews, I agree that these are not your everyday all day ear buds, they are really designed for sleeping only.  The ANC works really well and I noted quite a difference between on and off.Last night I set them to use ANC until I was alseep and then go to local mode.  After 8 hours, I still had 30% of the battery left in each ear bud.  So far, the battery life has been great.  I have yet to spend a whole night with bluetooth and ANC on, however.  I haven't needed to.I know at $200 it seems like a lot to spend for ear buds that you only use for sleep and that aren't designed for super high quality audio sounds.  However, this week has been the best sleep week I've had in two months since those neighbors upstairs moved in.  You do need several nights to get used to the fit and feel.  Not because they are uncomfortable, but because when something new is in your ear and you aren't used to it, it can feel funny and weird which may keep you awake instead of helping you sleep.  But, give it a few nights, and if you are like me, they get more comfortable the more you wear them.  I can sleep on my side with these but I need a soft pillow.  A really firm pillow would hurt my ears after a few hours, as it would everyone else with anything in their ear.Everyone is a different size and shape, but I have found these A30's to be comfortable, and of high quality.  The app is full of options to help customize the experience, and they do what they claim they will do.  After this week, my wife (who is very thrifty) is asking if she can try these out and maybe get a pair because she notices such a difference in my morning wakefulness. Hope this helps those of you out there like me needed something to help get your sleep back.  I would definitely buy again and am grateful for this product.",

        "review": "As I get older, I find that I have more difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep. I usually have an air filter running to drown out unwanted noises, but following a recent trip out of town, I discovered I need something that I can easily travel with. I tried a couple of cheaper sleep earbuds of different sizes and simply could not sleep with them in. I have fairly small ears and am a side sleeper. I finally gave up trying to find an economical solution and purchased the Soundcore Sleep A30. The case is very smooth and pleasant to the touch. It feels high-end and of good quality. The buds themselves are really tiny! The silicone tips and wings are squishy and flexible. I love that Soundcore included a variety of tips and wings for a custom fit, and I selected the smallest sizes available. It was really easy to swap them out and they fit snugly in my ears. I am not concerned about them falling out, and if they do happen to get lost, there is a handy function in the settings that makes them beep at a very high decibel. Connecting to Bluetooth was not overtly complicated, but I do recommend using the QR Code in the box to read the user manual before getting started. My first night to sleep with the earbuds was a bit challenging, but I think I may have had the buds positioned incorrectly. Last night I turned the buds more horizontally according to the picture in the user manual and was able to sleep through the night. Once placed in a proper position, they were quite comfortable. The battery seems to be very good so far, and it lasted the whole night. The app has a ton of settings and options. You can even create your own white noise mix. The app and the user manual provide tips on how to maximize battery life using various settings. Local mode seems to be a better choice than Bluetooth mode for longevity. I noted the ACN works wonderfully for low frequency noises, though you do have to give it a couple of minutes to fully kick in. It almost eliminates the noise of an annoying ceiling fan in my office, but I can still hear when someone sends a chat message. There is functionality for making and receiving phone calls in the app settings, though I do not have that turned on and have not tested it, yet. I am not an audiophile, but music and shows sound fine to me. I am hesitantly optimistic that I finally found sleep earbuds that will work for me!",

        "review": "I finally ended up with these earbuds after a nightmare journey having traded in my perfectly great Samsung (first series) earbuds for the new Samsung buds pro 2, which it turned out I am totally allergic to and couldn't even wear for 10 minutes without getting a severe reaction, shame on you Samsung, they know they have a big problem and refused to return and refund me the buds.So here the journey starts, and shout out to Best Buy who took back and refunded every pair I bought! As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and  upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case,  the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me. So far I'm pretty pleased, for the price point and quality I would highly recommend them, also for those of you who are struggling with reactions to their earbuds, so far these have been great",

        "review": "Final update - the right earbud issue has yet to repeat, so that's not an issue. As I've said, I have four other top end earbuds, and the only pair I use is the Soundcore A40. We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case).

The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.",

As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and  upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case,  the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me. So far I'm pretty pleased, for the price point and quality I would highly recommend them, also for those of you who are struggling with reactions to their earbuds, so far these have been great",

We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights.

While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights. The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.",

        "review": "WOW! It takes a lot these days for a purchase to genuinely blow me away, especially in the age of the countless low priced, questionable quality \u201caudiophile grade\u201d true wireless options out there. I have a pair on Sennheisser HD660s and Grado sr80s powered through a Fiios K5 Pro for at home listening. I needed something for the gym, being out and about, and most importantly travel.THESE THINGS ARE THE BEST TRUE WIRELESS EAR BUDS I HAVE EVER USED. Greatly prefer these to AirPods. I was expecting just a decent sounding pair of Bluetooth earbuds and had proper expectations for the super low price of these. What I got is something that has to be experienced to convey just how awesome these things are.Quick Pros/Things That Jumped Out-Extremely comfortable fit with a wide range of sizes for every ear canal > the App literally will run a test to check if you have a proper seal to ensure the best sound-THE APP! This is what has blown me away the most. This thing is BEAUTIFULLY designed and has some of the coolest features I have ever seen implemented in Bluetooth headphones:-running a hearing test to tell each separate ear\u2019s overall health when it comes to noise exposure and being able to pick up frequencies-Ability to toggle between different modes(music, spatial, movie, games)-Ability to adjust the degree of active noise cancellation, including different modes such as adaptive which will automatically adjust, being able to amplify sounds coming from a TV in the background for example, being able to have a conversation without pausing your music-THE EQ IS SO IMPRESSIVE. It runs a series of A B tests to determine your distinct sound preferences to multiple variations of the same song where you choose if either A or B sounds better.-Connection is effortless, the buttons are not only easy to actually use on the ear buds, but they are fully customizable-COMFORT. I have been wearing these for 5 hours now and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I don\u2019t even notice them. Haven\u2019t had to take them out a single time to let my \u201cears breathe\u201d-Super durable build. Was surprised by the heft of the case and buds themselves-MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL- The sound quality is simply unparalleled as far as Bluetooth buds go. I would buy these for $200 without question. The EQ makes it so no matter your preference, you can tweak the sound to exactly how you like it. The fidelity, clarity, bass, highs, vocals, etc all shine.This is one of the best purchases I have made in years and could not be more pleased",

More refined sound quality, a giant leap in Noise Cancellation,  ergonomics of tapping have improved significantly, connection speed...basically in every respect a vast improvement. Definitely worth the upgrade, especially for the incredibly cheap price they are being offered for.I give them 4 stars though for one reason: The darned case. It's horrible. Soundcore must have put together a design group with the challenge to create the worst possible case for these otherwise brilliant earphones. The surface is slippery like a small bar of wet soap. The case is jet black and top and bottom are exactly the same other than a microscopic and virtually invisible Soundcore logo on top. The catch to open it is also very small and uncomfortable so the soap case can slip out of your hands. I had to paint a big white dot on the top left hand corner to orient myself and use extreme caution every time I open the case. A shame for what are otherwise such brilliant earphones.",

Comfort is excellent too: the lightweight design and snug fit make them easy to wear for hours without fatigue. Durability is impressive: the IP55 rating keeps them safe from sweat and rain, and the sturdy case feels built to last. Adaptive noise cancelling works brilliantly in different environments, while the real-time translation feature adds unique value for travel. With long battery life and fast charging, these earbuds are reliable for everyday use. Overall, they combine premium sound, comfort, smart features, and rugged design at a great price.",

The ANC is effective as well.I previously used the Jabra Elite Pro 7 earbuds, which are more expensive and the right ear buds stopped charging on 2 different sets.The only thing that I do not like is that the case is fairly large. It is almost twice the size the Jabra Elite Pro 7 case but if the battery life is longer & charging is faster, it's acceptable.Overall, the P31i are a great value for the cost. I just got them so I am unsure about the durability or battery life.",

The sound is very impressive, with it without the passthrough enabled. They just sound fantastic . No dropouts or dead spots so far. The noise cancelling is very good. You can definitely tell that it works. They fit nicely and comfortably. The case snaps closed so they don't fall out easily like the Skull Candy ones did.

        "review": "I own a pair of Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which I absolutely love for their amazing noise-canceling feature. They completely block out airplane noise \u2014 even when I\u2019m seated right next to the wing \u2014 and are my go-to travel companion. However, once I started working out regularly, I quickly realized that my Bose earbuds weren\u2019t ideal for the gym. They constantly fell out during strength training, and I got tired of picking them up off the floor mid-set.So I decided to try the Powerbeats Pro, which are heavily marketed for athletes. While they did stay securely on my ears during workouts, I was disappointed by the lack of noise cancellation. Despite the claims, there was virtually no difference between the noise-canceling and transparency modes, and for the price (nearly $300!), that was a huge letdown.After doing more research, I came across the Soundcore Sport earbuds. I already use several Anker products and have been happy with their quality, so while I was initially skeptical due to the lower price point, I decided to give it a try.First off, these earbuds have their own app \u2014 something the Powerbeats Pro didn\u2019t. The app lets you customize sound modes, adjust bass, and fine-tune audio settings to your liking. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, on par with much more expensive earbuds. I tested them while walking around my neighborhood and during peak hours at the gym. I could barely hear people grunting or chatting nearby (which is one of my biggest gym pet peeves!).They also stay perfectly in place during strength training, which was my top priority. Combined with the excellent noise cancellation, these quickly became my new favorite pair of workout earbuds. I happily returned my Powerbeats Pro the very next day.If you\u2019re looking for comfortable, secure earbuds with real noise cancellation and great sound quality at a reasonable price, these are a fantastic choice. You get premium features without the premium price tag \u2014 truly a great value and a solid purchase.",

It seems to have lost the ability to read the case/charger's charge level, but the light on the case still works for that purpose. Equalizer sometimes gets overwhelmed and won't switch settings. You get better battery life if you minimize use of app features and rely on the sound's source device for digital signal processing. Programmable control buttons is a pretty handy feature for me, but the buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. Reproduces Dolby Atmos immersive sound fairly decently. Fit in ears VERY WELL AND SNUG WITH NO COMFORT PROBLEMS. This simply cannot be overstated. Transparent and active noise canceling modes are nice. For the price, you probably can't go wrong with these.",

        "review": "These are a great fit, connect easily, and sound great too! Very impressed by what you get for the price. I had some Jabra Elite 8 Actives before this but had trouble keeping them in my ear during workouts. These stay in place and were less than half the price! I also love how much smoother and faster they connect to multiple Bluetooth sources. When I\u2019m working they\u2019re typically connected to both my iPhone and my laptop. When a call comes in on Teams or Jabber on my laptop, the music from my iPhone automatically pauses and allows me to take the call. My previous headphones didn\u2019t work well in these situations.Good sound cancelling. Haven\u2019t tried them while mowing yet.The only problems I\u2019ve experienced are that 1) they occasionally drop the connection from my laptop in the middle of a long call and 2) when taking a call on Teams sometimes the ringing continues in my headphones after I\u2019ve answered the call. (In that case, I hear both the person on the line and the ringing for ~5-10 seconds before the ringing stops.) Not sure if the root of these problems is the laptop (& its software) or the headphones. It\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s the laptop. Regardless, these issues are occasional enough that I still am happy with the purchase.Great battery life! I charge mine ~2x a week for the 2-3 hrs I use them each day. Case is secure and the headphones seat easily to charge.One final positive - I had trouble with the microphone noise cancelling on my previous headphones when taking calls in the car. In other words, people on the other end couldn\u2019t hear me easily. I drive an older truck thats somewhat loud, but these headphones have no problem cancelling out the background noise and allowing the person on the other end to hear me. (And yes, I\u2019ve asked them!)Overall, an excellent value. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a single pair of headphones for work, working out, and taking calls in the car.",

They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

Not a dealbreaker, just annoying when you\u2019re trying to adjust on the fly.Other than that, they work exactly how you\u2019d hope budget earbuds would.

They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage.

        "review": "Let me start out by saying that this is a very solid/compelling product in this price range.  The Liberty 4 NC's do a lot of things well for it's price point.  The Noise Cancelling for it's time was among the best(better than the Earfun Air Pro 4 in my experience) in class, the sound quality is decent out of the box(they offer EQ via the app if you want to tune it), battery life is superb(I can use it for hours in a single session), and the build quality is decent.I believe for it's price segment (varies throughout, but I'll pick the price point of say $60-70), it's a very strong contender and you can't go wrong with this product for the right price.However, I do have 2 qualms.. one of them is specific to me though so your mileage may vary:First, the fitting.. the shape of the earpiece does not fit my ear too well, I do not have large ears per-se, but I use the largest ear tips in order to get a better seal.  Not only do I have issues with getting a proper seal in my ear canal, but they also don't seat well in my ear, as they tend to fall out more easily.  I don't seem to have this issue with some other earbuds(like the Earfun Air Pro 4), but I do have this issue with the Liberty 4 NC's.  I will say that it's not necessarily a deal breaker though, just an annoyance, something to watch out for as it depends on your ears.Second qualm is the mic performance is just mediocre, though it is adequate for it's price class.I don't use transparency mode very often, but they seem to work ok.  I'm glad that these have a transparency mode at least.---I also wanted to note, as I alluded to earlier, that I have both the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC and the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.  I have tested both of these in a noisy cafe, and the Liberty 4 NC's noise cancelling is noticeably superior to the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  So depending on your priorities, I'd still say overall, I prefer the Liberty 4 NC's.",

        "review": "I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.  My wife called me when I was out while using the earfuns and she said I sounded fine.  I have not used these so far to talk on the phone while I ride so I cannot speak to that.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation on the Liberty\u2019s is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.Not knocking any of these, just trying to give an honest opinion to those who are debating  price/quality",

I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",

        "review": "First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels \"cheap\" or \"flimsy\". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a \"Soundcore Signature BassUp\". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",

        "review": "I\u2019d like to preface by saying that I just barely got these, so this is a first impression review (and also the only review I\u2019ve ever felt compelled to make on Amazon). But I\u2019ve gotta say, I already love these a lot. I\u2019ve never been able to afford good quality earbuds, so I\u2019m constantly looking for better, cheaper options - usually to no avail. But the sound quality of these for the price are FANTASTIC. Easily the best sounding earbuds I have ever owned, coming from somewhat of an audiophile. Not only that, but I also have small ears and tend to avoid earbuds all together due to the fact that earbuds generally really hurt my ears\u2026but these? Light weight, they fit nicely in my ear, and they provide smaller ear cushions as well, which I would usually have to take advantage of and I haven\u2019t had to change them - at least not yet. The app that pairs with them is really nice as well. It has an equalizer that you can utilize to adjust the audio to your own preference - which I personally haven\u2019t had to use, as I actually find the audio out of the box really balanced - and you can also actually reprogram the gestures to pause/play/etc to your liking if you don\u2019t like how they come. The app also has different audios you can listen to, from white noise, to rain, to the ocean, to a forest, etc., which I think is a great, considerate thing to add to the app. Incredibly easy set up as well. You take them out of the case, they blink for a second, and then immediately show up in your list to connect to in your bluetooth settings right out of the box. Nothing complicated at all. They also came fully charged which I was pleasantly surprised with. No having to wait around for them to charge to be able to actually try them upon receiving them. If I had to be nitpicky (as I know I\u2019ve been only saying positive things) I\u2019d say the only thing I\u2019m not overly pleased with is just the fact that the charging case feels a little bit cheap, plastic wise. That being said, I really like the strap that comes attached to the case to put on keys or a carabiner or something of the like (and yes, you can take it off!), and it\u2019s not like I expected the case to have the feel of an airpods case - you get what you pay for. It doesn\u2019t feel like it would break easily, though. Just a bit cheap-feeling to the touch, which isn\u2019t a big deal. Overall I would say that, so far, these are definitely a steal for their price. I happened to get them on sale for $18, but even the list price of $30 is worth it. If you\u2019re wanting good quality wireless earbuds that won\u2019t break the bank, these are definitely them. I\u2019ll make sure to update/edit if my feelings on these change, but as of now, no real complaints! 10/10!!",

        "review": "Battery life is longer than 9 hours. I got them at 630pm charged em for maybe n hour put em on around 730ish and fell asleep with em in and they were at 10% at 10am the next morning. I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the \"soundcore buds battery at 10%\" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Update Sept. 2025 5months later.Everything above still applies. Both buds still work and I way overwork these things. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have an earbud in more in a 24 hour period then I do not my wife constantly tells me how horrible it is for my ears to wear them and fall asleep with them in the way I do lol and I only charge them once a day, I could probably go once every 2 days if I forgot to charge them once but I choose to charge the case fully for work at night and I've never had the charging case even blink red. They're literally working all day and I switch them back and forth. Not a glitch or anything and the battery life is still top notch and sound quality has not dipped at all. I'm even more baffled that I use them the way I do and they still work like new 5 months later. I actually came here to buy another pair so I can leave a pair at work and one at home so I'm not using one pair to death the way I currently do. Buy em. I have a buddy who has the 10mm driver's and they're not as good as these. If your doom scrolling through Amazon looking for the right ones I'm telling you try these. It's barely $20 if you don't like em you only spent $20 but I'm 100% honest with my review and highly recommend buying these.Your welcome",

        "review": "This is my second pair of Sound Core earbuds. My first set lasted me for several years and I still use them, but thought I would have a second pair on hand just in case they fail. They have not failed yet. I love them! They are so comfortable to wear. They have great sound quality for the person on the other end of the phone as well as for me on my end of the phone. Pairing is a snap. I wear them when I am running and exercising. They stay in place, no problem. My last pair was white. This time I got the blue ones. The noise cancellation is awesome. But sometimes I just wear one earbud because I need to be aware of my surroundings while I\u2019m listening to a podcast or a phone call.  You can charge the earbuds in the case without plugging it in if your case is charged up. The case charges and the earbuds charge. The charge lasts at least 8 hours or more and gives you a prompt when it\u2019s running low. You can\u2019t beat the price. They are the best earbuds I have ever had and I\u2019ve tried all kinds, including much more expensive ones! (Up to $200). These are better quality sound, comfort and of course price than the super expensive ones. The case has a handy lanyard for easy grab/carry/ attach.",

The sound quality is also surprisingly acceptable.I have not had these on long enough to test out battery life or what not. I use this for workouts, so no more than an hr or so of actual use a day.I hate the touch controls, so had to turn it off using the app. Thankfully they let you turn all of the touch controls via the app, plus turn off the noise\\ping you hear when you brush up against the touch control....So this is as basic of use as you can get, which I look for in headphones.I am sick of haptic controls, touch controls, over-reliance of the accompanying app, and active noise cancelling features. All these stupid features are on all of the headphones now a days, and it annoys to no end.Especially ANC. I have them on my Momentum 4 headphones, and there is no real way to turn it off. You must install the Sennheiser app to enable transparency mode.... And even then its falsely off. I hate the feeling of ANC I hate how it works. Nobody likes it.I want a simple headphone I pop them in, they play audio. I put them back in the case, and they are off and charging.simple. stay out of my way with all of the extra garbage. Give me a headphone that does 1 thing, and make sure it has a hardware switch on it, and no press-to-hold power switch.The industry is bloated with trash so-called smart headphones. rant over.",

        "review": "Full disclosure - I have smaller ears and canals, and I am a side sleeper and I have been using these for the last 7 days.I am moving to a new town and decided to rent an apartment for a year to help me decide where to buy a house.  Well, the apartment walls and floors are not well insulated.  I hear footsteps, creaking floors, snoring through the wall, and sometimes can hear the tv shows they watch.  Needless to say, I was having serious trouble sleeping.  I could fall asleep pretty well (go to bed early), but I would be awakened at some point, or several points, in the night by all these noises, banging, walking, creaking, and snoring and was not able to get back to sleep.  I needed something to help.I tried Mack's foam ear plugs.  They work pretty good for noise reduction, but my ears would hurt and throb making my sleep difficult in that way.  I even had the small ears size.  They were comfortable to side sleep with.I bought some fake Loop alternatives as just ear plugs.  They were comfortable, did not throb like the Mack's in my ears, but did not block out enough sound.  When I tried a bigger ear plug piece, I found the throbbing ear syndrome again.  These were comfortable to side sleep with though.I then bought a cheap knock off brand of \"sleep buds\".  They were the most comfortable thus far.  They would bluetooth to my phone so I could play either music or some white noise from my phone.  They claimed to have ANC.  They were helpful to block out some sound because of the ear fit, and because they could bluetooth to my phone for music or white noise.  However, with the ANC on or off, I did not detect any difference in sound reduction.  These were kidney bean shaped sleep buds and did not stick out much from my ear.  The ear plug piece was comfortable, but the harder plastic part would start to be annoying after a few hours when on my side.  They were ok.  Sound quality was decent. Maybe a C+ for an overall grade for these.  However, they didn't stop all the sounds and I still woke up occasionally.I hesitantly tried the A30's.  This is no small investment! With the rubbery ear plug piece and ear fin, these buds were comfortable.  While on my side, they have been the most comfortable thus far.  I can sleep well with them in actually.  I still have a little bit of pressure while on my side, but some nifty pillow management helped relieve the pressure.  I am using the attachments they came with out of the box. I really like the white noise sounds.  I have Still Lake as my favorite.  It is a sutble sound that helps my brain drift off.  With the fit of the A30 alone, I can block out most of the noise for the night with these standard size pieces without using ANC.  Last night, I had both my wife snoring and banging on the ceiling above.  (To be honest, my wife's snoring is not super loud but enough to wake me up). Then I realized I didn't have the ANC on.  Well, i turned the ANC on and WOW what a difference.  It was almost like I had over the ear headphones with ANC on.  All that noise disappeared.  I was very impressed, at least I recall being impressed.  I was asleep!!The sound quality is perfect for night time sleeping.  In reading other reviews, I agree that these are not your everyday all day ear buds, they are really designed for sleeping only.  The ANC works really well and I noted quite a difference between on and off.Last night I set them to use ANC until I was alseep and then go to local mode.  After 8 hours, I still had 30% of the battery left in each ear bud.  So far, the battery life has been great.  I have yet to spend a whole night with bluetooth and ANC on, however.  I haven't needed to.I know at $200 it seems like a lot to spend for ear buds that you only use for sleep and that aren't designed for super high quality audio sounds.  However, this week has been the best sleep week I've had in two months since those neighbors upstairs moved in.  You do need several nights to get used to the fit and feel.  Not because they are uncomfortable, but because when something new is in your ear and you aren't used to it, it can feel funny and weird which may keep you awake instead of helping you sleep.  But, give it a few nights, and if you are like me, they get more comfortable the more you wear them.  I can sleep on my side with these but I need a soft pillow.  A really firm pillow would hurt my ears after a few hours, as it would everyone else with anything in their ear.Everyone is a different size and shape, but I have found these A30's to be comfortable, and of high quality.  The app is full of options to help customize the experience, and they do what they claim they will do.  After this week, my wife (who is very thrifty) is asking if she can try these out and maybe get a pair because she notices such a difference in my morning wakefulness. Hope this helps those of you out there like me needed something to help get your sleep back.  I would definitely buy again and am grateful for this product.",

        "review": "As I get older, I find that I have more difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep. I usually have an air filter running to drown out unwanted noises, but following a recent trip out of town, I discovered I need something that I can easily travel with. I tried a couple of cheaper sleep earbuds of different sizes and simply could not sleep with them in. I have fairly small ears and am a side sleeper. I finally gave up trying to find an economical solution and purchased the Soundcore Sleep A30. The case is very smooth and pleasant to the touch. It feels high-end and of good quality. The buds themselves are really tiny! The silicone tips and wings are squishy and flexible. I love that Soundcore included a variety of tips and wings for a custom fit, and I selected the smallest sizes available. It was really easy to swap them out and they fit snugly in my ears. I am not concerned about them falling out, and if they do happen to get lost, there is a handy function in the settings that makes them beep at a very high decibel. Connecting to Bluetooth was not overtly complicated, but I do recommend using the QR Code in the box to read the user manual before getting started. My first night to sleep with the earbuds was a bit challenging, but I think I may have had the buds positioned incorrectly. Last night I turned the buds more horizontally according to the picture in the user manual and was able to sleep through the night. Once placed in a proper position, they were quite comfortable. The battery seems to be very good so far, and it lasted the whole night. The app has a ton of settings and options. You can even create your own white noise mix. The app and the user manual provide tips on how to maximize battery life using various settings. Local mode seems to be a better choice than Bluetooth mode for longevity. I noted the ACN works wonderfully for low frequency noises, though you do have to give it a couple of minutes to fully kick in. It almost eliminates the noise of an annoying ceiling fan in my office, but I can still hear when someone sends a chat message. There is functionality for making and receiving phone calls in the app settings, though I do not have that turned on and have not tested it, yet. I am not an audiophile, but music and shows sound fine to me. I am hesitantly optimistic that I finally found sleep earbuds that will work for me!",

I've always owned the noise canceling in ear earbuds but after hours of listening, they're so uncomfortable. But obviously that's a difference between the two.I like them because I can hear everything around me at a lower volume, situational awareness, yet they're loud enough to drown out outside noise depending on what you're doing.They're so comfortable I literally don't even feel them on my ears. Emphasis, on my ears. Additionally, they will never fall off no matter what you're doing, unless you're boxing or wrestling.The sound is great, the app is great and the comfort is perfect.They connect to two devices at once and while you're watching one and then switch to the other it changes flawlessly and goes back flawlessly. IE, TV to phone.Based on my OCD research, they are perfect for what I need them for. Hearing outside noise when I want to and being loud enough when I'm outside.I almost forgot, the call clarity is perfect. I can hear everyone.

The app will tell you how much battery life remains and how much battery is left in your charging case. And I think if you drop them in the case for 15 or 30 minutes you get another 3 hours of use.

I treated myself to an expensive set: Powerbeats Pro 2. They stayed faithfully on my head during all exercise, but they sound awful. Their defect is that they have to be positioned with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION in order to deliver bass and midrange. Five minutes into my exercise routine and I have already lost it.The AeroClips work for me. They stay in place and deliver correct sound even if I stand on my head. I can wear them for two hours without discomfort, maybe more.To be fair, the Powerbeats are more fully-featured. They have wireless charging.  They have active noise reduction (mid, but still). They offer excellent integration with Apple products, including access to settings and battery levels from desktop, tablet, or phone. Also, twice as expensive.Too bad that those Powerbeats don't work for me. In fact, these AeroClips are the only buds I know of that do work.",

        "review": "These headphones are a fantastic option if you\u2019re looking for something comfortable, low profile, and a little different from the typical over ear or in ear designs. What really sets them apart is how they project sound directly toward your ears with very little sound leakage  perfect for listening without disturbing people around you.A heads-up: when mine arrived, they weren\u2019t charged out of the box. So, definitely make sure to charge them fully before trying to pair or test them out. Once charged, the pairing process was super simple and hassle-free. I also recommend downloading the Soundcore app if you want to fine-tune the sound output  it gives you more control over the listening experience.The comfort level is impressive. I threw them on, and within minutes I forgot I was even wearing them. The sound is clear and crisp, not overly bass heavy, and easy on the ears. I actually almost fell asleep wearing them that\u2019s how comfortable they are.The only real downside is that they\u2019re not sweat or water resistant. So if you\u2019re planning to wear them during workouts or in unpredictable weather, just be aware. It would\u2019ve been great if some level of water resistance was built in, but that\u2019s really the only drawback I\u2019ve found so far.Overall, these are a solid, unique pair of headphones for casual everyday use.",

I treated myself to an expensive set: Powerbeats Pro 2. They stayed faithfully on my head during all exercise, but they sound awful. Their defect is that they have to be positioned with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION in order to deliver bass and midrange. Five minutes into my exercise routine and I have already lost it.The AeroClips work for me. They stay in place and deliver correct sound even if I stand on my head. I can wear them for two hours without discomfort, maybe more.To be fair, the Powerbeats are more fully-featured. They have wireless charging.  They have active noise reduction (mid, but still). They offer excellent integration with Apple products, including access to settings and battery levels from desktop, tablet, or phone. Also, twice as expensive.Too bad that those Powerbeats don't work for me. In fact, these AeroClips are the only buds I know of that do work.",

        "review": "These headphones are a fantastic option if you\u2019re looking for something comfortable, low profile, and a little different from the typical over ear or in ear designs. What really sets them apart is how they project sound directly toward your ears with very little sound leakage  perfect for listening without disturbing people around you.A heads-up: when mine arrived, they weren\u2019t charged out of the box. So, definitely make sure to charge them fully before trying to pair or test them out. Once charged, the pairing process was super simple and hassle-free. I also recommend downloading the Soundcore app if you want to fine-tune the sound output  it gives you more control over the listening experience.The comfort level is impressive. I threw them on, and within minutes I forgot I was even wearing them. The sound is clear and crisp, not overly bass heavy, and easy on the ears. I actually almost fell asleep wearing them that\u2019s how comfortable they are.The only real downside is that they\u2019re not sweat or water resistant. So if you\u2019re planning to wear them during workouts or in unpredictable weather, just be aware. It would\u2019ve been great if some level of water resistance was built in, but that\u2019s really the only drawback I\u2019ve found so far.Overall, these are a solid, unique pair of headphones for casual everyday use.",

        "review": "Let me start out by saying that this is a very solid/compelling product in this price range.  The Liberty 4 NC's do a lot of things well for it's price point.  The Noise Cancelling for it's time was among the best(better than the Earfun Air Pro 4 in my experience) in class, the sound quality is decent out of the box(they offer EQ via the app if you want to tune it), battery life is superb(I can use it for hours in a single session), and the build quality is decent.I believe for it's price segment (varies throughout, but I'll pick the price point of say $60-70), it's a very strong contender and you can't go wrong with this product for the right price.However, I do have 2 qualms.. one of them is specific to me though so your mileage may vary:First, the fitting.. the shape of the earpiece does not fit my ear too well, I do not have large ears per-se, but I use the largest ear tips in order to get a better seal.  Not only do I have issues with getting a proper seal in my ear canal, but they also don't seat well in my ear, as they tend to fall out more easily.  I don't seem to have this issue with some other earbuds(like the Earfun Air Pro 4), but I do have this issue with the Liberty 4 NC's.  I will say that it's not necessarily a deal breaker though, just an annoyance, something to watch out for as it depends on your ears.Second qualm is the mic performance is just mediocre, though it is adequate for it's price class.I don't use transparency mode very often, but they seem to work ok.  I'm glad that these have a transparency mode at least.---I also wanted to note, as I alluded to earlier, that I have both the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC and the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  In my opinion, other than the fitting issue(these don't seat well in my ear, and the eartips struggle a bit to get a good seal.. perhaps due to the angle of the shape of the earbuds), the Liberty 4 NC's are a notch better as a product compared to the EAP4's, especially when it comes to Noise Cancelling.  I have tested both of these in a noisy cafe, and the Liberty 4 NC's noise cancelling is noticeably superior to the Earfun Air Pro 4's.  So depending on your priorities, I'd still say overall, I prefer the Liberty 4 NC's.",

        "review": "I've gone through several pairs of cheap and mid-price ear buds (< $100).  Three I like are the earfun pro 3, 1more comfobuds pro, and now the Anker Liberty 4NC.  Overall the Ankers win hands down.  I think they have the best sound and by far the best wind resistance.  After you load up their app and connect to the buds it gives you a hearing test to give a base level of response, then gives a bunch of A-B comparisons to a piece of music asking which one you prefer as it tweaks the response curve.  I think the end result is great, but I'm no audiophile and am 65, so take that for what it is worth.  The other two are good, too (I rate the 1more buds above the earfun's, but I like them all).  I got the 1mores first, and if I were only going by sound quality I'd have stopped there (glad I didn't, but I didn't know that at the time!).I usually listen to them when I ride my bike on a local rails-to-trails path.  The downfall of the 1mores is that there is a lot of wind noise that comes through.  Noise cancelling overall is good, but not for wind.  So I saw the earfuns on sale, so tried them.  Much better wind noise reduction, but still more than I'd like.  Finally I saw these and bought a pair on their launch.  As I mentioned above the sound is great, and the wind noise reduction is very, very good.  I hear a little from time to time, but most of the time I feel the wind on my face but can only hear it if I am really looking for it.  They have a lot of modes you can set it too, but the one that works the best for me against wind is manual mode, maximum (level 5) noise cancelling with wind reduction on.They remember their settings no problem after you take them out of their case.  The earfuns seemed to turn off sometimes (go back to non-cancelling mode).  The worst thing about that in the earfun case is that in order to connect to the buds with their app you MUST have an internet connection.  This was a problem on my last flight as you might imagine.  The 1mores were great on the flight -- and no issues about connecting to the app  in flight.  It was a transatlantic flight and they ran out of juice so I switched to the earfuns for a while so they could get enough charge back into them.  With the 1mores the engine noise and other extraneous airplane sounds were almost gone and I enjoyed my music.  I have not flown with the Anker's yet.  Hopefully they will do as well as the 1more's there (but I'll have the 1more's along just in case!).  Supposedly the battery lasts longer in the Anker's, but only ride for about 3 hours at a time so I have not tested that.One final GREAT thing about the Ankers vs the others I've tried is that you can disable the on-bud controls.  I always have my phone on my bike, so if I need to change modes I can do so.  Since I found settings I like I don't need to anyway....  In the app you can select what every combination of taps does individually.  And every combination has a do nothing setting.  You'll still get a beep if you trigger the setting while inserting or wiggling the bud around, but it has no effect.  Just what I want.  If I want to skip a song my phone is right there, usually with the app up that is playing said songs.Sometimes I start hearing wind, and that just means the buds have slipped a bit.  A quick twist or wiggle and the wind is gone.  They've never fallen out, but I'm riding a recumbent so I'm just sitting in a lawn chair while I pedal.I use these only for listening to music.  My wife called me when I was out while using the earfuns and she said I sounded fine.  I have not used these so far to talk on the phone while I ride so I cannot speak to that.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation on the Liberty\u2019s is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.Not knocking any of these, just trying to give an honest opinion to those who are debating  price/quality",

        "review": "I've been using these since March 2025. I normally am not a fan of earbuds, I find them uncomfortable to wear after more than 30 minutes. However I ordered memory foam earpads has the ear pads that come with this headset didn't quite fit. With that one small $5 purchase of memory foam ear pads these earbuds turned out to be amazing. They have excellent noise canceling property, they are extremely comfortable to wear for hours at a time and I even forget I have them inserted.Sound quality is amazing, I'm a big fan of hearing bass when I listen to music and these do not disappoint. You can download an app for your phone to use them which is optional, but by downloading the app you can utilize a fit test to see how well the noise canceling is working.Telephone calls, no problem with the listener hearing me and vice versa.Not that it matters but the aesthetic is excellent because I like blue and I chose that model color.Battery life is highly impressive, once you charge the case you can use it for multiple recharges to the earbuds before you have to recharge the case. A bonus is that the case will work on a wireless charger and a wired charger depending on what you prefer to use.Overall, the price point is amazing considering that these are not some of the top of the line models that you may have heard about yet these perform at top of the line. I see no reason to purchase name brand earbuds for something that does the job if not exceeds the ones that are at the top of the line.",

        "review": "I am a serious music listener, and own many top-tier IEMs. My experience has always been that wireless IEMs are far inferior to wired. I purchased the Liberty 4 Pro as a replacement for my AKG N400 TWS set, which have gone kaput. I bought the Liberty 4 Pro on sale for $89, so I expected them to be functional, but not exceptional. My mistake.While these don't rival my best sets, they are a tremendous performance/price set. On a scale of 1-10, where my top set (ISN Audio EST80) is a 9, these are a solid 6.5. That's huge. My old AKGs were a 4 at best. Everything about the Liberty Pro is amazing. The sound is wonderful, really. But it's the sophistication of the electronics that makes them really shine. Let's talk about that.The case is excellent and charges the IEMs rapidly. One word of caution - if you change the eartips to a non-OEM pair, be certain they fit the case properly, or your IEMs may not charge. Onward --The app is where all the stuff happens. There are hearing tests to help you design a custom EQ profile along with 22 built-in EQ profiles. If there isn't one there that tweaks these IEMs to you liking, check your hearing. These are all well designed, and very effective. There are so many options to customize your listening experience. I'm really impressed.The ANC is superb and, unlike my old AKGs, the quality of the sound doesn't change as you increase/decrease the ANC. That really impressed me.All in all, these are not just excellent TWS IEMs, but excellent IEMs all around. Depending on your music choices and listening habits, these might just be the only IEMs you need.",

The dual pairing is the feature that was lacking in lower models of Soundcore buds. This is the 4th pair of these that i have bought. Not because the others have failed, but because i use them in different places for different things and just love them. One pair at the office paired to my phone and computer. One in my home office again paired with phone and computer. One in my workshop paired with the TV and phone and one for travel paired with my phone and tablet. They just work, are very comfortable and the noise cancelling is spectacular. I knocked one start off for the tips themselves. I like the \"mushy\" tips and have tried several replacement ones but they never seem to fit in the case so prevent charging.

I do not know why the ear wings aren't on all earbuds, they are so comfortable and clearly keep them from falling out of your ear, which is my biggest nuisance with a lot of them, as you start to feel it sliding out. These fit perfect, can't fall out. Now onto the sound.....the bass on these are so gooood! The overall sound quality for these earbuds are amazing. When I use these I don't feel I am missing out in comparison to over the head headphones. I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",

        "review": "First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels \"cheap\" or \"flimsy\". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a \"Soundcore Signature BassUp\". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",

        "review": "I finally ended up with these earbuds after a nightmare journey having traded in my perfectly great Samsung (first series) earbuds for the new Samsung buds pro 2, which it turned out I am totally allergic to and couldn't even wear for 10 minutes without getting a severe reaction, shame on you Samsung, they know they have a big problem and refused to return and refund me the buds.So here the journey starts, and shout out to Best Buy who took back and refunded every pair I bought! As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and  upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case,  the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me. So far I'm pretty pleased, for the price point and quality I would highly recommend them, also for those of you who are struggling with reactions to their earbuds, so far these have been great",

        "review": "Final update - the right earbud issue has yet to repeat, so that's not an issue. As I've said, I have four other top end earbuds, and the only pair I use is the Soundcore A40. We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights. The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.",

        "review": "These things are AMAZING for the price.GREAT sound, LOUD if need be, super decent noise canceling, batteries last for freaking ever on ANC (~4 hours or so on the LDAC high quality setting)The only downside is I work construction and if you have the noise canceling enabled and put on ear muffs they'll SCREAM high pitched noises in your ears incessantly.. I've owned dozens of other headphones and none of them have done as these do.",

        "review": "I spent at least 10 hours looking for And watching videos about in the ear and over-the-ear earbuds.I got these as a Christmas present to myself and I couldn't be happier.All the videos were true, I purchased them for $99 before Christmas and they are excellent!It's the first pair of over-the-ear earbuds I've ever owned and I love them. I've always owned the noise canceling in ear earbuds but after hours of listening, they're so uncomfortable. But obviously that's a difference between the two.I like them because I can hear everything around me at a lower volume, situational awareness, yet they're loud enough to drown out outside noise depending on what you're doing.They're so comfortable I literally don't even feel them on my ears. Emphasis, on my ears. Additionally, they will never fall off no matter what you're doing, unless you're boxing or wrestling.The sound is great, the app is great and the comfort is perfect.They connect to two devices at once and while you're watching one and then switch to the other it changes flawlessly and goes back flawlessly. IE, TV to phone.Based on my OCD research, they are perfect for what I need them for. Hearing outside noise when I want to and being loud enough when I'm outside.I almost forgot, the call clarity is perfect. I can hear everyone. And when I tell them I have these new earbuds in they tell me they can hear me perfectly, indoors and outside.Like I said, I reviewed so many for hours and decided on these. I'm so glad I did.5 stars all the way. Not one negative thing about them.Oh, And the battery life lasts forever. I've had them in my ears for over 7 hours and they still held up. The app will tell you how much battery life remains and how much battery is left in your charging case. And I think if you drop them in the case for 15 or 30 minutes you get another 3 hours of use. I'm guessing 30 minutes in the case, they're fully charged.Anker, who I thought was only battery chargers owns soundcore. I still have one of their battery chargers from 10 years ago and it's working like the day bought it.I really hope this long review convinces you to buy what I was hoping for. Which is exactly what wanted and got.And I wish more normal people like me would post like I just did, to let people know honestly what they should buy without being sent one for free and then BSing everyone.Wait until they're on sale for $99 again.",

The clip\u2011on, open\u2011ear design is what makes them special: you get your music or podcasts clearly, but you\u2019re never cut off from the world\u2014no need to fight that pressure or feeling of sound trapped behind your ears. They feel ultra\u2011light, secure, and easy to forget you\u2019re wearing them.Sound is clean and balanced, with good bass for an open style, and the app gives useful tweaks if you want to tune things. Battery life is solid\u2014about a full day\u2019s casual use\u2014so I rarely worry about charging. Reviewers also note the comfy fit, reliable controls, and strong overall value for the price, which matches my experience.",

        "review": "I have a problem with earbuds. I use them mainly for exercise, so getting them to stay in place is the first issue that comes up. I treated myself to an expensive set: Powerbeats Pro 2. They stayed faithfully on my head during all exercise, but they sound awful. Their defect is that they have to be positioned with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION in order to deliver bass and midrange. Five minutes into my exercise routine and I have already lost it.The AeroClips work for me. They stay in place and deliver correct sound even if I stand on my head. I can wear them for two hours without discomfort, maybe more.To be fair, the Powerbeats are more fully-featured. They have wireless charging.  They have active noise reduction (mid, but still). They offer excellent integration with Apple products, including access to settings and battery levels from desktop, tablet, or phone. Also, twice as expensive.Too bad that those Powerbeats don't work for me. In fact, these AeroClips are the only buds I know of that do work.",

        "review": "These headphones are a fantastic option if you\u2019re looking for something comfortable, low profile, and a little different from the typical over ear or in ear designs. What really sets them apart is how they project sound directly toward your ears with very little sound leakage  perfect for listening without disturbing people around you.A heads-up: when mine arrived, they weren\u2019t charged out of the box. So, definitely make sure to charge them fully before trying to pair or test them out. Once charged, the pairing process was super simple and hassle-free. I also recommend downloading the Soundcore app if you want to fine-tune the sound output  it gives you more control over the listening experience.The comfort level is impressive. I threw them on, and within minutes I forgot I was even wearing them. The sound is clear and crisp, not overly bass heavy, and easy on the ears. I actually almost fell asleep wearing them that\u2019s how comfortable they are.The only real downside is that they\u2019re not sweat or water resistant. So if you\u2019re planning to wear them during workouts or in unpredictable weather, just be aware. It would\u2019ve been great if some level of water resistance was built in, but that\u2019s really the only drawback I\u2019ve found so far.Overall, these are a solid, unique pair of headphones for casual everyday use.",

I had no issue pairing the ear phones to my iPhone, just followed the included directions and pictures carefully.Sound quality is amazing. Clear highs, mid-tones, and great bass response. These levels can be adjusted in the Soundcore App if you'd like a different experience. Phone calls with only one ear bud worked well also. There was no problem  hearing or being heard. They charge remarkably fast too, which is a plus.The only controls set up initially are for music play/pause/skip and for answering/disconnecting a call.

I had no issue pairing the ear phones to my iPhone, just followed the included directions and pictures carefully.Sound quality is amazing. Clear highs, mid-tones, and great bass response. These levels can be adjusted in the Soundcore App if you'd like a different experience. Phone calls with only one ear bud worked well also. There was no problem  hearing or being heard. They charge remarkably fast too, which is a plus.The only controls set up initially are for music play/pause/skip and for answering/disconnecting a call. Controls can be customized in the Soundcore App to your preference. This includes volume controls as well as several others.I highly recommend these ear buds. They are some of the best I've ever owned for a very budget conscious price.",

        "review": "Excellent ear phones for an incredible bargain (got at 50% off). Have only used in-ear headphones before, and they were never comfortable and never stayed in my ears no matter what I tried (all the different size tips, over the ear versions, etc.). These stay in place, are so comfortable I don\u2019t even remember I have them on, and the sound quality is excellent. They are very customizable for sound and control functionality. Can be a little annoying because the controls are touch-sensitive, so it is hard to put them on without accidentally touching the controls. If you want a want a simple plug-and-play, these aren\u2019t it. But the minor annoyance is worth the comfort and sound quality. The company offers many features through the app. I will likely never use any of them (I just want simple ear buds), but nice to have the option if I ever change my mind.",

        "review": "Connectivity: Pairing was easy and straight forward; audio quality is great (particularly once equalizer was adjusted to my taste. Oh, and for those new to Anker Soundcore products, you WILL need to download the APP to access and use full features); they fit perfectly fine around my ears with no danger of falling off/out even when I vigorously shake my head; sound quality did NOT alter once I put on my knit winter cap as regularly occurs with standard earbuds due to the buds inside the ear canal being depressed further inside or otherwise shifting around; while these may not be 'noise cancelling' they do still drown out plenty of ambient noise; volume is great! That does it for the Pros.Cons: Just one. There is NO WAY to determine the battery life of the CASE! In the app it shows the battery life of the individual buds. Great! But there is nothing for the case. I've got a pair of Soundcore SportX20 and these DO have an indicator for the case along with the buds. So I KNOW the technology exists. Why'd yo guys skimp on this feature? This is why I had to dock you One Star for this lapse.Otherwise, great product!Edit: Jan 2, 2026. Okay, so after I scanned the QR code for the on-line manual, I learned that the battery life reading for the case can be interpreted thus\u2026when you re-install the ear buds into the case if the case light is STEADY, then there is 46% to 100% power. However, if the light is blinking then there remains anywhere from 45% to 0% power. So, if it\u2019s blinking you may as well plug in and recharge. That\u2019s something, but I still prefer a more accurate reading instead of a range.",

Sound quality is not fabulous, but good, as expected for moderately priced technology.  You can download their App to your phone if you want to customize all the options like prerecorded background sounds like oceans and forests and white noise.

The adjustable ear piece is a plus and so far seem to have really good battery life. Their SoundCore App for iPhone is one of the best I\u2019ve used if needed. The iPhone app upgraded my headset firmware and you can also adjust the touch controls to your liking on both ear pieces.Note: Tho works on my iPhone fine, \u201cCurrently\u201d this app isn\u2019t available for download on Windows PC\u2019s in the United States region. Our headsets also work BlueTooth connected with both the iPhone & my Windows11 PC; playing either takes precedence to the headset.

        "review": "I got these as a lower-cost replacement for the 1st generation AirPods Pro that I had used for a few years (before one of the pods finally met its unfortunate demise), and I\u2019d say they\u2019re just about as good all-around as those were. The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I\u2019m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore\u2019s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I\u2019m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I\u2019m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple\u2019s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple\u2019s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I\u2019ve accepted that earbuds in general just won\u2019t last forever with daily use, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I\u2019m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore\u2019s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",

I have tried many audio devices and have never quite had the experience that I've been able to receive from soundcore audio. I have purchased the p20, p3i, p40i's twice (one for me and my wife), I also have the space q45, I also recently purchased and reviewed the Aero Fit pro.As far as the p40i they fit a lot differently than the p3is. I personally had issues keeping them in my ears without them falling out which led to their demise in a toilet. However while I had them their voice quality seemed unmatched. Posting the capacity for six mics not only does the noise canceling work amazingly. Near comparable to the q45s capacity. The sound distribution is fantastic providing a deep into you sound.  Touch base control makes it interesting and easy to trigger. In my opinion they are not set up for movement like sports or other physical activities. Connectivity, functionality, battery life and volume control function flawlessly. And overall clarity and value for money they offer a little more than the cheaper variety.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.",

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

I have a pair on Sennheisser HD660s and Grado sr80s powered through a Fiios K5 Pro for at home listening. I needed something for the gym, being out and about, and most importantly travel.THESE THINGS ARE THE BEST TRUE WIRELESS EAR BUDS I HAVE EVER USED. Greatly prefer these to AirPods. I was expecting just a decent sounding pair of Bluetooth earbuds and had proper expectations for the super low price of these. What I got is something that has to be experienced to convey just how awesome these things are.Quick Pros/Things That Jumped Out-Extremely comfortable fit with a wide range of sizes for every ear canal > the App literally will run a test to check if you have a proper seal to ensure the best sound-THE APP! This is what has blown me away the most. This thing is BEAUTIFULLY designed and has some of the coolest features I have ever seen implemented in Bluetooth headphones:-running a hearing test to tell each separate ear\u2019s overall health when it comes to noise exposure and being able to pick up frequencies-Ability to toggle between different modes(music, spatial, movie, games)-Ability to adjust the degree of active noise cancellation, including different modes such as adaptive which will automatically adjust, being able to amplify sounds coming from a TV in the background for example, being able to have a conversation without pausing your music-THE EQ IS SO IMPRESSIVE. It runs a series of A B tests to determine your distinct sound preferences to multiple variations of the same song where you choose if either A or B sounds better.-Connection is effortless, the buttons are not only easy to actually use on the ear buds, but they are fully customizable-COMFORT. I have been wearing these for 5 hours now and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I don\u2019t even notice them. Haven\u2019t had to take them out a single time to let my \u201cears breathe\u201d-Super durable build. Was surprised by the heft of the case and buds themselves-MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL- The sound quality is simply unparalleled as far as Bluetooth buds go. I would buy these for $200 without question. The EQ makes it so no matter your preference, you can tweak the sound to exactly how you like it. The fidelity, clarity, bass, highs, vocals, etc all shine.This is one of the best purchases I have made in years and could not be more pleased",

Soundcore must have put together a design group with the challenge to create the worst possible case for these otherwise brilliant earphones. The surface is slippery like a small bar of wet soap. The case is jet black and top and bottom are exactly the same other than a microscopic and virtually invisible Soundcore logo on top. The catch to open it is also very small and uncomfortable so the soap case can slip out of your hands.

I do not know why the ear wings aren't on all earbuds, they are so comfortable and clearly keep them from falling out of your ear, which is my biggest nuisance with a lot of them, as you start to feel it sliding out. These fit perfect, can't fall out. Now onto the sound.....the bass on these are so gooood! The overall sound quality for these earbuds are amazing. When I use these I don't feel I am missing out in comparison to over the head headphones. I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",

        "review": "First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels \"cheap\" or \"flimsy\". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a \"Soundcore Signature BassUp\". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",

        "review": "These have been the best earbuds I've come across so far. I do not know why the ear wings aren't on all earbuds, they are so comfortable and clearly keep them from falling out of your ear, which is my biggest nuisance with a lot of them, as you start to feel it sliding out. These fit perfect, can't fall out. Now onto the sound.....the bass on these are so gooood! The overall sound quality for these earbuds are amazing. When I use these I don't feel I am missing out in comparison to over the head headphones. I use these with my Ipod Nano and sometimes through my phone, been perfect to pair it up and sounds great with both. Being able to wirelessly charge them is also really cool. The case is great. Literally zero complaints while I've had these so far for a couple of years. I had some Jabra's before and it was lacking a lot with bass, was blown away by how much punch these had. I was worried it would either be only a little extra or maybe some kind of distorted bass, but it is super crisp and punchy.If looking for some great sounding earbuds, that is super affordable on top of it....I don't see how anyone would be disappointed with these.",

        "review": "First, please know that I purchased these earbuds in May of 2021. They are now over 4 years old and still working fine for my needs. Here's how I felt using these earbuds roughly 3-4 times a week for hours per occurrence.Pros- Doesn't break the bank but isnt as cheap as those 20 dollar no name ones you can get on Amazon that change their name but remain the same product.- Sound quality is good, not great. Bass is there but not to a point where I was impressed. I would say overall they sounded passable for music. For podcasts, which I listened to mostly with these, is fantastic. Voices are crisp and cut through any background noise.- Noise cancellation, don't really notice it, not sure if it doesn't even have it or I just haven't turned it on.- Battery life was great for the first few years, as of now 4 + years in, a single charge of the carrying case and buds inside will get me about 20 hours of podcasts at a loud volume.Cons - the rubber ear tips. Not the ones that go into your ear canal and cover the speaker, I'm referring to the ones that sit on top of the earbud and assist with keeping the earbud in place. They are an AMAZING addition. I mean, I could play pick up basketball games with these in and they'd be rock solid the entire time. The bad part comes into the picture now, a few years later. They've stretched out to a point they don't function like they should and the buds fall out easily.  I went to purchase a replacement and Anker is sold out for the past month. It's a damn shame I'll have to replace a perfectly good part of earbuds because Anker doesn't support their products properly post sale.Tldr: Good earbuds for podcast and some music, company support for replacement parts sucks.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace my Bose Sport earbuds. While I wanted something that would give me great audio, I didn't want to spend what I paid for those previous earbuds; these Soundcore Life A1do not disappoint, in fact, they are exceeding my expectations.Bluetooth Pairing: Open the case, go to bluetooth settings on the device and select the Life A1 buds. Done. Literally took me less than 15 seconds. Once my devices were paired, as soon as I take a bud out of its case it's already connecting to the last device I used, and by the time I have it popped in my ear, it's ready to go.Comfort and Fit: These buds come with several sizes of plugs, and three sizes of wings. After a little trial and error to get the right fit for my ears, these are so comfortable, I forget I have them in after a while. They are lightweight, they don't pinch anywhere, and I can easily wear these for an entire day at my desk without any discomfort whatsoever.Controls: Like many earbuds these days, you can control several common functions by pressing the earbuds (play/pause, volume up/down, answer/reject calls, Siri, etc.). One thing that surprised me is that these are actual buttons, and not just a touch-control like some other buds have.Build Quality and Design: Both the case and the earbuds are light, but at the same time, feel like they are made to last. Nothing feels \"cheap\" or \"flimsy\". The case has a solid magnetic closure design, there is no play in the hinges of the case lid. The buds themselves are riding that fine line between lightweight and feeling substantial enough to feel like a quality earbud.Battery Life and Charging: I can easily go all day long with these buds. I used them continuously for 9 hours on one single charge. The case and the buds themselves charge quickly. And as an added bonus, not only can you charge the case via the USB-C charging port, you can also use a wireless charger.The App: There is a Soundcore app you can download that offers some additional options. It allows you to customize the button controls although your only options of functions to assign to button presses are volume, play/pause, next/previous, Siri, or no action. The app also offers equalizer settings, but you are limited to their 21 presets; 20 equalizer configuration presets and a \"Soundcore Signature BassUp\". While these presets will most definitely do the trick, I was slightly disappointed there was no option for a custom EQ preset the user can make on their own.Overall, I am incredibly impressed by the value, less than $40 for all of this? And to be honest, these sound at least as good as my previous Bose earbuds.",

        "review": "This is the first time I've purchased a Soundcore product and I wasn't quite sure if I would like an open-ear ear bud. However, they were inexpensive, probably because they are an older model, so I decided to give them a try. They are wonderful. Super comfortable to wear, no having to stuff into my ear. The hook around the ear is soft and light weight yet it holds the phones very securely. The hook can be adjusted for a comfortable fit. I almost couldn't tell they were there.  I had no issue pairing the ear phones to my iPhone, just followed the included directions and pictures carefully.Sound quality is amazing. Clear highs, mid-tones, and great bass response. These levels can be adjusted in the Soundcore App if you'd like a different experience. Phone calls with only one ear bud worked well also. There was no problem  hearing or being heard. They charge remarkably fast too, which is a plus.The only controls set up initially are for music play/pause/skip and for answering/disconnecting a call. Controls can be customized in the Soundcore App to your preference. This includes volume controls as well as several others.I highly recommend these ear buds. They are some of the best I've ever owned for a very budget conscious price.",

Have only used in-ear headphones before, and they were never comfortable and never stayed in my ears no matter what I tried (all the different size tips, over the ear versions, etc.). These stay in place, are so comfortable I don\u2019t even remember I have them on, and the sound quality is excellent. They are very customizable for sound and control functionality. Can be a little annoying because the controls are touch-sensitive, so it is hard to put them on without accidentally touching the controls. If you want a want a simple plug-and-play, these aren\u2019t it. But the minor annoyance is worth the comfort and sound quality. The company offers many features through the app. I will likely never use any of them (I just want simple ear buds), but nice to have the option if I ever change my mind.",

        "review": "Connectivity: Pairing was easy and straight forward; audio quality is great (particularly once equalizer was adjusted to my taste. Oh, and for those new to Anker Soundcore products, you WILL need to download the APP to access and use full features); they fit perfectly fine around my ears with no danger of falling off/out even when I vigorously shake my head; sound quality did NOT alter once I put on my knit winter cap as regularly occurs with standard earbuds due to the buds inside the ear canal being depressed further inside or otherwise shifting around; while these may not be 'noise cancelling' they do still drown out plenty of ambient noise; volume is great! That does it for the Pros.Cons: Just one. There is NO WAY to determine the battery life of the CASE! In the app it shows the battery life of the individual buds. Great! But there is nothing for the case. I've got a pair of Soundcore SportX20 and these DO have an indicator for the case along with the buds. So I KNOW the technology exists. Why'd yo guys skimp on this feature? This is why I had to dock you One Star for this lapse.Otherwise, great product!Edit: Jan 2, 2026. Okay, so after I scanned the QR code for the on-line manual, I learned that the battery life reading for the case can be interpreted thus\u2026when you re-install the ear buds into the case if the case light is STEADY, then there is 46% to 100% power. However, if the light is blinking then there remains anywhere from 45% to 0% power. So, if it\u2019s blinking you may as well plug in and recharge. That\u2019s something, but I still prefer a more accurate reading instead of a range.",

You can download their App to your phone if you want to customize all the options like prerecorded background sounds like oceans and forests and white noise.  But these connect fine to devices that do not have a User Interface, like a device that connects to a TV audio out.  Works great with Alexa too.  I had a Bluetooth connection issue at first, contacted customer support and they were excellent helping me out.  Turned out the problem was on my end, the buds worked great.

The adjustable ear piece is a plus and so far seem to have really good battery life. Their SoundCore App for iPhone is one of the best I\u2019ve used if needed. The iPhone app upgraded my headset firmware and you can also adjust the touch controls to your liking on both ear pieces.Note: Tho works on my iPhone fine, \u201cCurrently\u201d this app isn\u2019t available for download on Windows PC\u2019s in the United States region. Our headsets also work BlueTooth connected with both the iPhone & my Windows11 PC; playing either takes precedence to the headset. I particularly like that the open ear type also works well for those who also need to hear some of what\u2019s around you. And, for me no long term ear itch from an in the ear bud. These are great!",

These were highly rated and so I took the Plunge...Boy, was I amazed at all the features- Functionally: super good sound, Perfect size and portability, relatively easy pairing (took a couple of times). These speakers are made solidly and I like the loop that allows attachment to a belt or to hang in a room for surround sound.Battery- Decided, like most electronics, to fully charge the pair before use- took approximately 1 hour for both. I have been playing this pair, moving around the house to test distance connectivity... 60 feet apart, both are without static interruption. One speaker in the bathroom and one in the dining room; one in the living room and one in the master bedroom- quality of music the same. Volume quality balance remains very good at 8/10 without irregularities in base or treble.After pairing, went to my Youtube music library on my iPhone, turned on my speed dial to Jazz, and WOW!!!!!!!For the price, these are almost 98% as good as my Bose speakers. They are lighter and worth every dollar, and can be placed anywhere in the house. See the pictures",

        "review": "This was an absolute elite gift for my son\u2019s first birthday. I was shocked at how amazing this little speaker sounds. I have a 4 year old little JBL speaker and this one sounds better. I\u2019ve found myself borrowing it for my workouts in the garage.As far as the speaker itself it\u2019s lightweight, well built, and looks nice. The controls are responsive and nice. After charging it the first time it was extremely easy to pair with my devices, and I\u2019ve had no issues with the Bluetooth. The battery lasts at least as long as promised, but seems like more to me.The app you can use with this is a nice feature. You can use custom equalizer settings, but I\u2019ve found the standard one sounds great. You can also choose how long you want the speaker to remain idle before it turns off.If you\u2019re interested in this for a baby or toddler: This is the perfect size for a little one. It is durable, waterproof, and the charging port is covered. From the first day my son received this he carried around the speaker wherever he went to play. He holds it up to me when he would like it turned on.When paired with an iPad you can set a maximum volume, so even if he did get to the volume buttons it\u2019s completely safe and not too loud at the max. Before having this speaker my son would carry around Baby Einstein musical toys, and keep them going while he played. We usually play the baby Einstein playlists on Apple Music which he loves (and the songs sound MUCH better) but there\u2019s other kids music too. The one feature that will take some time for my son to use is the skip because you have to press the play/pause button two times quickly. I\u2019m sure that he will learn more quickly than I expect.I almost spent $140+ on a toddler music system that would have cost me $20 every time we wanted a new set of about 15 songs. Instead we have this awesome little speaker, a less expensive music subscription, and I get to use it too.Photo features average sized board book for scale.",

        "review": "First off, I have read many reviews of this Sooundcore speaker before making my selection to purchase it. I seldom use a portable speaker but there are times when I do not want to use ear buds, headphones, or bone conduction haedphones.  I smoke/grill meat in the backyard a lot and I like to listen to some music while I am tending to the grill/smoker. I wanted a speaker that was tough, portable, waterproof/dustproof, but with good sound quality and battery life. The Soundcore Select 4 Go fit those needs.  I like the fact you can use the Soundcore app to use preset equalizer settings or customize your own. One little feature I like is I can power off the speaker through the app and I have used it a few times. Another feature the speaker has that I may or may not use is that you can pair another Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker to give you better sound.  However, remember this is a small portable speaker and has its limitations in sound quality and volume.  If you are wanting a speaker for a portable out door use this speaker is good for it.  However, if you wanting a portable speaker for playing party music at a large gathering indoor or outdoor then I would look into a better speaker which Soundcore also makes. I selected this model of Soundcore speaker model  because it met my needs size, battery life, sound quality and price.  This speaker is worth trying out and seeing if it fits your needs.",

Remember, you're looking for affordable yet reliable earbuds, and these deliver on that front.DurabilityThe material is strong plastic. Within the first week, I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer (I forgot to take them out of my pocket). The charging lights stopped working for a couple of weeks but eventually came back to normal. That\u2019s impressive durability! I\u2019ve also dropped them almost daily, and they don\u2019t even have a crack. Bonus points for durability because I work in building maintenance, and they\u2019ve been in my pocket with screws, utility knives, and other tools\u2014they\u2019ve held up really well.ComfortThey\u2019re not the most comfortable earbuds out there. After about 4 hours of use, my ears do start to hurt, but you get used to it over time. If you bend over, they\u2019re likely to slip out of your ears.

(I rarely use the EQ function).My only small complaint is the microphone on these isn't great. For phone calls it isn't terrible but if you're recording audio for any purpose it is noticeably muffled & lacks noise reduction.Aside from that I don't think you can go wrong with these if you're just looking for a high quality pair of everyday headphones.*I did have an issue with the bass blowing out in one of my ear buds (caused by volume accidentally being turned all the way up really fast). But they do have a warranty & Anker had a new pair sent out within a few days. It was one of the easiest and best customer experiences I've ever had.

If you're on a budget and looking for good-quality earbuds, this review might be helpful for you.I bought these earbuds on October 27, 2023, and I\u2019ve been using them consistently up until today, January 22, 2025.Sound QualityThe sound quality is good\u2014very decent, especially considering the price. Remember, you're looking for affordable yet reliable earbuds, and these deliver on that front.DurabilityThe material is strong plastic. Within the first week, I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer (I forgot to take them out of my pocket). The charging lights stopped working for a couple of weeks but eventually came back to normal. That\u2019s impressive durability! I\u2019ve also dropped them almost daily, and they don\u2019t even have a crack. Bonus points for durability because I work in building maintenance, and they\u2019ve been in my pocket with screws, utility knives, and other tools\u2014they\u2019ve held up really well.ComfortThey\u2019re not the most comfortable earbuds out there. After about 4 hours of use, my ears do start to hurt, but you get used to it over time. If you bend over, they\u2019re likely to slip out of your ears. You can feel them sliding, so you have time to catch them before they fall. To be fair, this happens with pricier earbuds like AirPods, too.Battery LifeThis is by far my favorite feature. Even after washing them, the battery continues to perform great. I charge them every 3 days, and I use them for at least 4 hours a day. I\u2019ve tried other earbuds like JBL and AirPods, but their battery life doesn\u2019t compare to these.

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

I\u2019ve only had to charge them twice in 4 months. They sound really good with the adaptive noise cancellation and custom equalizer. The microphone quality could be better, but the value for price is INSANE. The different sized tips fit any ear and the functionality it overall the best I\u2019ve seen.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit.

        "review": "I had a pair of the AirPod Pros for a couple years when I blew out the left one when my sound was accidentally turned to max one day.  They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.  And for the price, these make an amazing gift as well.",

The microphone quality could be better, but the value for price is INSANE. The different sized tips fit any ear and the functionality it overall the best I\u2019ve seen.",

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds.

        "review": "I\u2019d like to preface by saying that I just barely got these, so this is a first impression review (and also the only review I\u2019ve ever felt compelled to make on Amazon). But I\u2019ve gotta say, I already love these a lot. I\u2019ve never been able to afford good quality earbuds, so I\u2019m constantly looking for better, cheaper options - usually to no avail. But the sound quality of these for the price are FANTASTIC. Easily the best sounding earbuds I have ever owned, coming from somewhat of an audiophile. Not only that, but I also have small ears and tend to avoid earbuds all together due to the fact that earbuds generally really hurt my ears\u2026but these? Light weight, they fit nicely in my ear, and they provide smaller ear cushions as well, which I would usually have to take advantage of and I haven\u2019t had to change them - at least not yet. The app that pairs with them is really nice as well. It has an equalizer that you can utilize to adjust the audio to your own preference - which I personally haven\u2019t had to use, as I actually find the audio out of the box really balanced - and you can also actually reprogram the gestures to pause/play/etc to your liking if you don\u2019t like how they come. The app also has different audios you can listen to, from white noise, to rain, to the ocean, to a forest, etc., which I think is a great, considerate thing to add to the app. Incredibly easy set up as well. You take them out of the case, they blink for a second, and then immediately show up in your list to connect to in your bluetooth settings right out of the box. Nothing complicated at all. They also came fully charged which I was pleasantly surprised with. No having to wait around for them to charge to be able to actually try them upon receiving them. If I had to be nitpicky (as I know I\u2019ve been only saying positive things) I\u2019d say the only thing I\u2019m not overly pleased with is just the fact that the charging case feels a little bit cheap, plastic wise. That being said, I really like the strap that comes attached to the case to put on keys or a carabiner or something of the like (and yes, you can take it off!), and it\u2019s not like I expected the case to have the feel of an airpods case - you get what you pay for. It doesn\u2019t feel like it would break easily, though. Just a bit cheap-feeling to the touch, which isn\u2019t a big deal. Overall I would say that, so far, these are definitely a steal for their price. I happened to get them on sale for $18, but even the list price of $30 is worth it. If you\u2019re wanting good quality wireless earbuds that won\u2019t break the bank, these are definitely them. I\u2019ll make sure to update/edit if my feelings on these change, but as of now, no real complaints! 10/10!!",

        "review": "Battery life is longer than 9 hours. I got them at 630pm charged em for maybe n hour put em on around 730ish and fell asleep with em in and they were at 10% at 10am the next morning. I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the \"soundcore buds battery at 10%\" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Update Sept. 2025 5months later.Everything above still applies. Both buds still work and I way overwork these things. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have an earbud in more in a 24 hour period then I do not my wife constantly tells me how horrible it is for my ears to wear them and fall asleep with them in the way I do lol and I only charge them once a day, I could probably go once every 2 days if I forgot to charge them once but I choose to charge the case fully for work at night and I've never had the charging case even blink red. They're literally working all day and I switch them back and forth. Not a glitch or anything and the battery life is still top notch and sound quality has not dipped at all. I'm even more baffled that I use them the way I do and they still work like new 5 months later. I actually came here to buy another pair so I can leave a pair at work and one at home so I'm not using one pair to death the way I currently do. Buy em. I have a buddy who has the 10mm driver's and they're not as good as these. If your doom scrolling through Amazon looking for the right ones I'm telling you try these. It's barely $20 if you don't like em you only spent $20 but I'm 100% honest with my review and highly recommend buying these.Your welcome",

        "review": "I spent at least 10 hours looking for And watching videos about in the ear and over-the-ear earbuds.I got these as a Christmas present to myself and I couldn't be happier.All the videos were true, I purchased them for $99 before Christmas and they are excellent!It's the first pair of over-the-ear earbuds I've ever owned and I love them. I've always owned the noise canceling in ear earbuds but after hours of listening, they're so uncomfortable. But obviously that's a difference between the two.I like them because I can hear everything around me at a lower volume, situational awareness, yet they're loud enough to drown out outside noise depending on what you're doing.They're so comfortable I literally don't even feel them on my ears. Emphasis, on my ears. Additionally, they will never fall off no matter what you're doing, unless you're boxing or wrestling.The sound is great, the app is great and the comfort is perfect.They connect to two devices at once and while you're watching one and then switch to the other it changes flawlessly and goes back flawlessly. IE, TV to phone.Based on my OCD research, they are perfect for what I need them for. Hearing outside noise when I want to and being loud enough when I'm outside.I almost forgot, the call clarity is perfect. I can hear everyone. And when I tell them I have these new earbuds in they tell me they can hear me perfectly, indoors and outside.Like I said, I reviewed so many for hours and decided on these. I'm so glad I did.5 stars all the way. Not one negative thing about them.Oh, And the battery life lasts forever. I've had them in my ears for over 7 hours and they still held up. The app will tell you how much battery life remains and how much battery is left in your charging case. And I think if you drop them in the case for 15 or 30 minutes you get another 3 hours of use. I'm guessing 30 minutes in the case, they're fully charged.Anker, who I thought was only battery chargers owns soundcore. I still have one of their battery chargers from 10 years ago and it's working like the day bought it.I really hope this long review convinces you to buy what I was hoping for. Which is exactly what wanted and got.And I wish more normal people like me would post like I just did, to let people know honestly what they should buy without being sent one for free and then BSing everyone.Wait until they're on sale for $99 again.",

        "review": "I have a problem with earbuds. I use them mainly for exercise, so getting them to stay in place is the first issue that comes up. I treated myself to an expensive set: Powerbeats Pro 2. They stayed faithfully on my head during all exercise, but they sound awful. Their defect is that they have to be positioned with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION in order to deliver bass and midrange. Five minutes into my exercise routine and I have already lost it.The AeroClips work for me. They stay in place and deliver correct sound even if I stand on my head. I can wear them for two hours without discomfort, maybe more.To be fair, the Powerbeats are more fully-featured. They have wireless charging.  They have active noise reduction (mid, but still). They offer excellent integration with Apple products, including access to settings and battery levels from desktop, tablet, or phone. Also, twice as expensive.Too bad that those Powerbeats don't work for me. In fact, these AeroClips are the only buds I know of that do work.",

        "review": "These headphones are a fantastic option if you\u2019re looking for something comfortable, low profile, and a little different from the typical over ear or in ear designs. What really sets them apart is how they project sound directly toward your ears with very little sound leakage  perfect for listening without disturbing people around you.A heads-up: when mine arrived, they weren\u2019t charged out of the box. So, definitely make sure to charge them fully before trying to pair or test them out. Once charged, the pairing process was super simple and hassle-free. I also recommend downloading the Soundcore app if you want to fine-tune the sound output  it gives you more control over the listening experience.The comfort level is impressive. I threw them on, and within minutes I forgot I was even wearing them. The sound is clear and crisp, not overly bass heavy, and easy on the ears. I actually almost fell asleep wearing them that\u2019s how comfortable they are.The only real downside is that they\u2019re not sweat or water resistant. So if you\u2019re planning to wear them during workouts or in unpredictable weather, just be aware. It would\u2019ve been great if some level of water resistance was built in, but that\u2019s really the only drawback I\u2019ve found so far.Overall, these are a solid, unique pair of headphones for casual everyday use.",
