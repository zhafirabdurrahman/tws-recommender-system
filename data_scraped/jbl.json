        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

I wanted waterproof so I could listen to my books or music in the shower as I got ready in the morning, but I have to remember to change the tapping settings (pause, skip, volume, Siri, etc) to off before or else EVERY water drop will cause it to do something. ANYTHING that brushes the side of the device while wearing it causes it to do something, usually pausing it for me, but if it brushes back AND forth, it may skip ahead. It\u2019s just annoying. Whatever. Still better than most because I have the OPTION of using in water. And it still works after without sounding wonky (if your ears are dry; putting them INTO wet ears make them slippery and sound weird out of shower).I am buying another set because I lost one of them rushing upstairs to wake up my kids for a tornado siren (false alarm). Since they are fairly cheap, I don\u2019t even mind just replacing it.  The lost feature is pretty worthless-if it\u2019s dead (or out of range?), it will tell you it can\u2019t be found, not last known location or last time used\u2026Nothing helpful. I had to wait until after work to look, and it must have been drained by then.It charges quick; but it\u2019s annoying when it keeps beeping (or speaking: battery low) to remind me. I wish I could limit reminders so it would just stop playing after a warning. I like falling asleep to a book and the beep or voice prompt abruptly wakes me up/stops that process unnecessarily.",

The wireless headphones stay charged for a very long duration. There are a little pricey but worth the money. They fit well in my ears. However, after a few hours, the extra rubber piece that gives it a better hold to the ear, starts to cause pain. So I\u2019m not able to wear and use them for a long time period. I\u2019ve been impressed with the design until recently. A piece that covers the plastic ear tip has come out. Which has made it collect dust down inside the earbud. They are very hard to clean once the ear rubber size is taken off, especially if there is dust or a little bit of ear wax.I would still recommend and buy again. Hoping the construction and pieces are more durable.",

        "review": "I purchased these on three different occasions. The first pair I purchased in December, 2023 were great!! I workout quite consistently and heavily and sweat a lot. The first pair continued to deliver great sound and remain in my ear even during the most intense of workout sessions.Sadly, I lost my first pair two months after buying them (my fault) and purchased a second pair without hesitation. The second pair held up well until after a while they didn't. After a couple of years, one ear went bad until both earbuds eventually didn't produce any sound regardless of how charged they were. No big deal. I chalked it up as it being time to replace them.In May, 2025, I purchased a brand new third set. I don't know what happened in two years since the purchase of the first/second sets or if this set was just malfunctioned, but these buds could not handle my workouts. Sweat would cause one earbud (mainly the right one) to clog and not produce any sound and the sound quality of the other earbud was horrible. The volume would go very low (even with the volume turned all the way up) and the sound was garbled. UGGGHHHH!!! So disappointing!!! I dealt with them like this for three months holding out hope that these were just rare instances that would eventually correct over time. No such luck! Also the buds would loosen from my ears and slowly slide out of position (sometimes falling out). To remedy this I would wear bandanas to help hold them in place. SO ANNOYING!!I just don't want to deal with this anymore, so into the drawer of used and dead electronic items it goes along with the old cell phones, non-working chargers, and the second pair of lame JBL Race earbuds. I'm really bummed, but it's time to move on to better!  One star.",

The touch controls were the first to start having problems, then the headphones wouldn\u2019t turn off after putting them back in the case causing the batteries to drain from the earbuds and case, on top of that the charging system isn\u2019t very effective and for me showed a lot of problems, sometimes the charging light would not come on so I couldn\u2019t tell if they were charging in the first place, then the last time I tried plugging them in it completely shorted out the block they were plugged into. These are a good buy if you aren\u2019t planning on using them daily or for long term, this is quite disappointing because all other jbl products I have still work after 5+ years of use, I think this model specifically is just kind of prone to breaking after about a year.",

The first pair continued to deliver great sound and remain in my ear even during the most intense of workout sessions.Sadly, I lost my first pair two months after buying them (my fault) and purchased a second pair without hesitation. The second pair held up well until after a while they didn't. After a couple of years, one ear went bad until both earbuds eventually didn't produce any sound regardless of how charged they were. No big deal. I chalked it up as it being time to replace them.In May, 2025, I purchased a brand new third set. I don't know what happened in two years since the purchase of the first/second sets or if this set was just malfunctioned, but these buds could not handle my workouts. Sweat would cause one earbud (mainly the right one) to clog and not produce any sound and the sound quality of the other earbud was horrible. The volume would go very low (even with the volume turned all the way up) and the sound was garbled. UGGGHHHH!!! So disappointing!!! I dealt with them like this for three months holding out hope that these were just rare instances that would eventually correct over time. No such luck! Also the buds would loosen from my ears and slowly slide out of position (sometimes falling out). To remedy this I would wear bandanas to help hold them in place. SO ANNOYING!!I just don't want to deal with this anymore, so into the drawer of used and dead electronic items it goes along with the old cell phones, non-working chargers, and the second pair of lame JBL Race earbuds.

I wanted waterproof so I could listen to my books or music in the shower as I got ready in the morning, but I have to remember to change the tapping settings (pause, skip, volume, Siri, etc) to off before or else EVERY water drop will cause it to do something. ANYTHING that brushes the side of the device while wearing it causes it to do something, usually pausing it for me, but if it brushes back AND forth, it may skip ahead. It\u2019s just annoying. Whatever. Still better than most because I have the OPTION of using in water. And it still works after without sounding wonky (if your ears are dry; putting them INTO wet ears make them slippery and sound weird out of shower).I am buying another set because I lost one of them rushing upstairs to wake up my kids for a tornado siren (false alarm).

They sound really, really good -- but only when I apply pressure to them, push them into my ears and hold them.3. I dropped one into a sink full of water for two or three seconds (totally submerged). I expected it to die but it still played! (Another time sweat ran down into my ear and conked it out for the evening.)4. The free JBL Headphones app has an equalizer, as well as some other features, which will allow you to make some adjustments to the sound ( I tried it but didn't notice a big difference and ended up uninstalling it to free up memory).5. Some people claim you can mold your own earbud tips and improve the fit and sound quality.The Bad:1. They don't fit snuggly. I tried the different sized rubber ear tips that came with it and none of them are quite right.2. The sound is very thin. This is 100% a fit issue. Shove them in and hold them and they sound really good.3. When the batteries get low you get an audible \"battery is low\" message. Fine but as the battery gets lower, the message eventually stats coming every twenty seconds or so (maybe faster). It's quite annoying.4. Getting them in and out of the case is somewhat of a PITA due to some design issues.",

        "review": "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

        "review": "These earbuds are the best replacement for my AirPods (RIP) out of the 2 others I\u2019ve tried. The sound quality is really good, they\u2019ve got a good bass response and good clarity so you hear the nuances in music. I\u2019ve tried jazz, classical, post-punk, and R&B music on them and they sound good with those, but I can\u2019t yet say how phone calls sound bc I haven\u2019t tried that yet. Battery life is really long, and the case almost never needs recharging! These are more versatile than the other earbuds I tried. I got them because you can use them with or without the sealing suction cup ear tip thingies. I like them without, because this way (1)they stay in place and don\u2019t work their way loose from my ears every few minutes just like other sealing tip earbuds used to do, they let air through so they don\u2019t make my ears all sweaty and gross, and (2)if something happens that I need to hear, I can pause the music and hear outside of the earbuds without having to fumble with taking the earbuds out. I live in a violent area and I need to be able to hear my surroundings for my own safety. The app is pretty nice, it lets you choose the functions that happen when you tap them, or even disable tapping functions, which I do sometimes so I don\u2019t accidentally skip songs etc. just because I accidentally touched them. It also lets you adjust the EQ with presets or custom settings. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had earbuds with an app and at first I thought it\u2019d be dinky to have an app for my earbuds, but i changed my mind to like it because it works well and you can just set it and forget it. As for reliability, these don\u2019t seem to have the connection issues that people on Reddit reported that they had. Maybe these are an updated model? I\u2019ve had them for about a week and they are behaving just like any normal Bluetooth device. Pretty hassle-free. I\u2019m happy.UPDATE: after just 11 months of light to moderate use, they are doing the thing where one bud\u2019s battery drains from 100% to nothing in 5 minutes, they\u2019re failing to stay disconnected from the phone even when they\u2019re supposed to be charging . Also the case gets stuck charging to only 10%.UPDATE 2: there is a fix for this, after which the earbuds are working well again: you have to stick a few layers of little pieces of tape in the inside of the lid to make it push the buds down harder into the pins when closed, so they both charge (the problem is, the springs for the pins goes bad over time, so they don\u2019t make good contact). Then to clear out the glitches caused by this case fiasco you have to factory reset the buds according to the quick start guide, and then do this: open the JBL app, remove the buds to make them pair to the app, then put them back in the case BUT LEAVE THE LID OPEN, then in the app tap \u201cpower off.\u201d I\u2019ve had no more problems since.",

        "review": "Update after 1.5 years:Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge.  First happened at 6 months.  Exchanged under warranty.  One year later, having the same issue.I have liked them.  They have good sound and are easy to use.  But I would not order them again.  I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models.  Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200.Side note:  JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly.Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from \"low battery\" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

        "review": "As someone who puts a lot of thought into the details that matter to everyday users, the JBL Tune Flex earbuds genuinely impressed me.What really sets these apart is the versatility. The ability to switch between sound pass-through and full noise blocking makes them incredibly adaptable\u2014whether I\u2019m zoning out to a playlist, locking in on an audiobook or podcast, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet without the pressure of removing the earbuds. Comfort is excellent; they\u2019re easy to wear for extended periods without fatigue, which is something many earbuds still get wrong.Audio quality is clean, balanced, and exactly what you\u2019d expect from JBL\u2014reliable and satisfying across different listening styles. Battery life carries me through most of a full workday with consistent use. While I wouldn\u2019t complain about a little extra runtime, it\u2019s far from a dealbreaker and fits well within real-world expectations.Overall, the JBL Tune Flex feels like a thoughtfully designed, daily-driver set of earbuds that delivers where it counts.

Battery life is really long, and the case almost never needs recharging! These are more versatile than the other earbuds I tried. I got them because you can use them with or without the sealing suction cup ear tip thingies. I like them without, because this way (1)they stay in place and don\u2019t work their way loose from my ears every few minutes just like other sealing tip earbuds used to do, they let air through so they don\u2019t make my ears all sweaty and gross, and (2)if something happens that I need to hear, I can pause the music and hear outside of the earbuds without having to fumble with taking the earbuds out. I live in a violent area and I need to be able to hear my surroundings for my own safety. The app is pretty nice, it lets you choose the functions that happen when you tap them, or even disable tapping functions, which I do sometimes so I don\u2019t accidentally skip songs etc. just because I accidentally touched them. It also lets you adjust the EQ with presets or custom settings. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had earbuds with an app and at first I thought it\u2019d be dinky to have an app for my earbuds, but i changed my mind to like it because it works well and you can just set it and forget it. As for reliability, these don\u2019t seem to have the connection issues that people on Reddit reported that they had. Maybe these are an updated model? I\u2019ve had them for about a week and they are behaving just like any normal Bluetooth device. Pretty hassle-free. I\u2019m happy.UPDATE: after just 11 months of light to moderate use, they are doing the thing where one bud\u2019s battery drains from 100% to nothing in 5 minutes, they\u2019re failing to stay disconnected from the phone even when they\u2019re supposed to be charging . Also the case gets stuck charging to only 10%.UPDATE 2: there is a fix for this, after which the earbuds are working well again: you have to stick a few layers of little pieces of tape in the inside of the lid to make it push the buds down harder into the pins when closed, so they both charge (the problem is, the springs for the pins goes bad over time, so they don\u2019t make good contact). Then to clear out the glitches caused by this case fiasco you have to factory reset the buds according to the quick start guide, and then do this: open the JBL app, remove the buds to make them pair to the app, then put them back in the case BUT LEAVE THE LID OPEN, then in the app tap \u201cpower off.\u201d I\u2019ve had no more problems since.",

        "review": "Update after 1.5 years:Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge.  First happened at 6 months.  Exchanged under warranty.  One year later, having the same issue.I have liked them.  They have good sound and are easy to use.  But I would not order them again.  I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models.  Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200.Side note:  JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly.Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from \"low battery\" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

        "review": "As someone who puts a lot of thought into the details that matter to everyday users, the JBL Tune Flex earbuds genuinely impressed me.What really sets these apart is the versatility. The ability to switch between sound pass-through and full noise blocking makes them incredibly adaptable\u2014whether I\u2019m zoning out to a playlist, locking in on an audiobook or podcast, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet without the pressure of removing the earbuds. Comfort is excellent; they\u2019re easy to wear for extended periods without fatigue, which is something many earbuds still get wrong.Audio quality is clean, balanced, and exactly what you\u2019d expect from JBL\u2014reliable and satisfying across different listening styles. Battery life carries me through most of a full workday with consistent use. While I wouldn\u2019t complain about a little extra runtime, it\u2019s far from a dealbreaker and fits well within real-world expectations.Overall, the JBL Tune Flex feels like a thoughtfully designed, daily-driver set of earbuds that delivers where it counts. A strong contender for anyone who values comfort, control, and dependable sound in their everyday audio gear.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

I gave it to my younger brother and got the JBL Tune 2, hoping to have the same experience. The product do have interesting updates, like the noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk-through options. Although I couldn\u2019t feel any difference between the first two, the talk-through option just lowers the volume and keep playing it. However, there are expressive downgrades compared to the first one:1) connection. If you get far away, it disconnects easily. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not expecting to be 30 meters away. However, the same distance I was perfectly able to use it on the first one, now, it completely disconnects.  ALSO IT UNSYNC RANDOMLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PHONE IN FRONT OF YOU. It had happened several times while I am writing this review. Something that was rare, now it happens DAILY2) battery. Although the battery is still very decent, nothing compared to the first one. That I had for almost a year and charged every 3 weeks. This one, I have to charge once a week. The earbuds have a good battery, but the case that charges it doesn\u2019t have as good as the first one.3) connection WHILE CLOSE. I am not sure how the connection is done, but if my phone is in my pocket upside down, the connection gets so unstable that every earbud loses its sync, and every single one starts playing in a different frequency. It\u2019s crazy this happens!!I am very unsatisfied with this product and have been facing these issues since day 1. But waited to see if was going to keep like that or not. I would suggest to get the previous version or another brand earbuds (which I can\u2019t recommend any bc I always preferred JBL due to its battery life)",

I put up a picture of what someone else did and made my own. I know it looks weird, but it really works well. So far I\u2019m happy with these. I will update if any issues arise.",

        "review": "It comes with 4 different sizes of ear tips, so one of them will always fit. It's one of the only earbuds to have open ear and silicone tips available, which is a big plus. The sound quality is perfect and has great bass, and the case is surprisingly small.The only downside is that the plastic feels somewhat cheap, but it's not that big of a deal. It looks amazing with a silicone case as well",

So when I saw these on sale I had to try them. The sound is fantastic and the bass is so full and balanced. Noise cancelling is not bad at this price point, ambient aware works well and allows you to hear around you while still listening to your music. The Talk through mode is great, just double tap the left bud and it's like they aren't even in your ears. I'm very happy with the performance. Battery life is solid with the charging case. Case is compact with a rounded shape, so easy carry in your pocket. No wireless charging but not a deal breaker for me.",

        "review": "I waited a couple months to give my honest, accurate and sad review.I had the JBL Tune Flex 1 for months and was amazing. I gave it to my younger brother and got the JBL Tune 2, hoping to have the same experience. The product do have interesting updates, like the noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk-through options. Although I couldn\u2019t feel any difference between the first two, the talk-through option just lowers the volume and keep playing it. However, there are expressive downgrades compared to the first one:1) connection. If you get far away, it disconnects easily. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not expecting to be 30 meters away. However, the same distance I was perfectly able to use it on the first one, now, it completely disconnects.  ALSO IT UNSYNC RANDOMLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PHONE IN FRONT OF YOU. It had happened several times while I am writing this review. Something that was rare, now it happens DAILY2) battery. Although the battery is still very decent, nothing compared to the first one. That I had for almost a year and charged every 3 weeks. This one, I have to charge once a week. The earbuds have a good battery, but the case that charges it doesn\u2019t have as good as the first one.3) connection WHILE CLOSE. I am not sure how the connection is done, but if my phone is in my pocket upside down, the connection gets so unstable that every earbud loses its sync, and every single one starts playing in a different frequency. It\u2019s crazy this happens!!I am very unsatisfied with this product and have been facing these issues since day 1. But waited to see if was going to keep like that or not. I would suggest to get the previous version or another brand earbuds (which I can\u2019t recommend any bc I always preferred JBL due to its battery life)",

I switched to these after years of using similar priced and designed (as far as I can tell) Sony earbuds.The noise cancelling seems a little less pronounced than on similar Sony earbuds I have used (may not be a bad thing) and does not deal with wind noise as well (not a good thing), but overall works pretty well for dampening non-wind background noise.  The overall sound quality is adequate for my main use-cases - listening to podcasts and books and doing phone calls and video conferences. If I were more focused on listening to music, I'd want something better and I think the Sony ones were a bit better.The headphones often disconnect from Bluetooth when I'm walking around; sometimes they reconnect within about 3-7 seconds; other times I need to do this manually.  That is frustrating but quickly solved. I have not had the problem with the JBL headphones that repeatedly occurred with several sets of Sony earbuds I had, where the left earbud would refuse for hours, days or \"forever' to connect to Bluetooth. Repeatedly facing that issue with several iterations of Sony earbuds (which I otherwise liked and think were better than these JBL earbuds) is what caused me to give up on Sony and give JBL a try.The headphones stay in my ears during exercise and through sweating and bouncing around.  So far, I'm happy with the battery life.",

The noise cancellation was so effective I could keep my volume lower and my ears feel much better. Still love them.Original review: I pre-ordered these to replace my aging JLB earbuds and I have been so pleased with them. The noise cancelling is like nothing I've ever experienced. I walk in the gym, it's loud in there (big chain gym). Once I turn on the noise cancellation (I use the functional training setting) WHOOSH, all of a sudden, all I can hear is my music. It's incredible. And these things can hold a charge like nothing else. They are very sweat proof. The sound quality is amazing, my music sounds so much better on these than my old earbuds. Getting a fit was easy and they stay in place all workout long, whether I'm lifting, on the elliptical or even doing aerobics. I love the customizable controls for taps. Everything about these is customizable! And they are also ready out of the box. Truly a great investment. With the noise cancelling I can keep the volume lower and it makes my ears feel much better. I do recommend if it's your first time with active noise cancelling (ANC), read up on what it does first. There's a good NYT article on it. All I can hear in the gym with ANC on full is clanking from weights, which is high frequency sound. The low frequency roar of treadmills and the vacuum them are always running is gone once I turn ANC on. Highly recommend, absolutely love them and a great value for the money.",

        "review": "First Thing: UPDATE these ear buds. You need to do it TWICE! Get the JBL app for your phone and software update the buds, then get the JBL Quantum Engine App for PC (or Mac) and do the firmware update. Before the updates I could only get one bud/channel to work with Android using the dongle, and after the updates both buds work. So far I have tested the USB-C Dongle with PC, Steam Deck, iPad, and Android - it works well with all devices listed providing low latency, and high(er) fidelity, sound. I tested multiple games on Steam Deck, including Hi-Fi Rush (a rhythm game), and had no latency issues. The Dongle is true plug and play (no setup needed) on every device except PC. Plugging in the USB-C Dongle prompted a download of Quantum Engine, and inside the QE app you can set EQ and tweak the Surround Sound settings. I tested the buds in Battlefield V on PC and the surround sound worked well. Adjusting the EQ in the QE app on PC is easy and necessary in order to get the most pleasing sound. The only device I\u2019m using Bluetooth with is my Android phone and the sound is fine - use the JBL app to adjust the EQ. The Android App offers a FULL EQ, not the typical/lame EQ for dummies a lot of ear bud devices ship with.I\u2019ve only had the JBL Quantum TWS Airs (that name lol) for a short time, so I can\u2019t offer a comprehensive review yet. I will say they are very light and fit well in my ears. There is no wing, or stabilizer, so these might not be great for active on-the-go situations. The stock EQ needed a tweak for my ears, and the Apps make that easy. The sound quality via the USB-C Dongle is a noticeable upgrade in terms of latency and fidelity. These are better for music than I anticipated, and from reviews I read this is one of the big differences from the more expensive, and older version, of this line of Quantum TWS buds. Battery life is much shorter using the Dongle, and that makes sense as the low latency signal is more power hungry than Bluetooth. I spent some time looking for low latency wireless ear buds and this is one the most affordable options out there ($40 on sale). Hopefully in time more companies will offer similar low latency earbuds, or maybe Bluetooth will get good enough to make a product like this irrelevant.",

The case is a little too big for carrying it on a pocket but still can fit. It charges pretty fast too and I appreciate that.The voice assistant is very useful, it can read and answer message and read u all your notifications. Also control smart home devices which I use a lot.Only problem with it is that the dongle doesn't work very well with other smartphones or tablets, I read that the Pc firmware update can fix that but my Pc doesn't have a usb-c port and I haven't been able to buy an adapter (and it can't connect to the pc app by Bluetooth for some reason).Definitely a good purchase still just for it's in-app customization, voice assistant features and sound quality.",

        "review": "So I bought these earbuds on discount for $75 on Black Friday, and I want to share some thoughts I have about this thing.1. It's not exactly perfectly low latency. I play rhythm games a lot, and I do notice a slight amount of latency even with the \"low latency\" dongle mode. I've tried disabling any audio processing on Windows, but it's still the same. The latency is fairly low given that it's wireless. You'll be hard pressed to notice for other games like Valorant, but there's just a touch of latency which prevents me from using it for rhythm games in particular.2. Audio is pretty good. Very bass heavy as you'd expect, but there is an EQ so you can change it around. Once you balance it out with the EQ I think the audio quality is quite exceptional for these buds.3. Battery life is mid. When you use it in low-latency mode the battery dies in around 3-4 hours without ANC or processing. Probably take off an hour if you had it on. The bluetooth mode lasts for much longer, I'd peg it around 6 hours (although I've never fully drained it in bluetooth yet).4. Charging is fairly fast for both the case and the earbuds.5. There are some strange audio artifacts (glitching and occasionally choppy audio) with the dongle. This happens very occasionally, and I've tried disabling interference like from Wi-Fi and other 2.4Ghz accessories but it still occurs.6. I think the touch controls are hard to learn. The one for switching modes is fairly straightforward, but pairing, switching, and learning play/pause is not intuitive.7. Noise cancellation is quite weak compared to many other earbuds on the market, similar with the \"transparency mode\" on these things. Talk-thru actually is OK, but sounds artificial and you can definitely tell the noise from outside is piped in.8. They sit comfortably in the ears and don't feel like they're gonna fall out. However, at least for me, they get uncomfortable over like 1 hour of wearing.Overall, given the discounted $75 price I think they're a great pair of buds, better than other $99 Bluetooth buds on the market. At the original $150, there are much better options (without low latency dongle).And gamers beware, if you are planning to use these for latency critical audio tasks, these are NOT for you. Stick to wired or look for something else. These get quite close but I still notice a tad bit of audio latency.",

Good base and sound quality, you can choose presets or adjust the sound settings directly in the app. The microphone is pretty strong too, I drive big trucks for work and it's really noisy in the cab, other headphones I've used struggle to hear what I'm saying when using voice prompts for siri or Gemini but not one issue yet (when prompting with the earbuds). I've used them in the shower, at the gym, even in the sauna and they still work really good. In the app you can set the touch buttons to do nothing so you're not interrupting music or anything. Pretty good battery life, comfortable for long term wear, has a really good ambient mode to be able to hear what's going on around you, worth the money id say.***In the shower before I figured out the touch button thing I put the ear buds down while I washed my hair, water got into the ear bud holes, they still worked but the right one sounded a tad bit weird, put em in rice for 24hrs just case and no problems",

        "review": "I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani  T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of  earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani  T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people",

They do not fall out.No fuether updates on this review as they were sadly stolen 3 months after purchase. My short time with them was good though! A bitter ending to a good story.Don't let them out of your sight :)",

        "review": "These are amazing.  Sound quality is fantastic and the app integration is legit.  I do kinda wish they had volume controls but other than that they are perfect for running.  They are heavy and stay in place securely wrapped around the ear with minimal jostling while running.  Worth the money, however, I did get them for 40% off so like 60 bucks which is not a bad amount for such a solid piece of equipment.  The charging case is sturdy and solid.  Feels and looks sleek and modern.  Absolutely love them.  If you are tired of crappy headphones that wear out quickly, fall out, or are just cheap, check these out.  You won\u2019t be disappointed, I\u2019m not.  \ud83d\ude0a",

I'm going to go to the gas station and buy a $5 pair, drive over them with my car a few times, and they'll still sound better and be more durable than these earbuds ever did.JBL, I never wanted to talk to you again, but you're about to hear from me. (Make sure you're not wearing the Vibe Buds!!)",

        "review": "For the price these are good. However, after a year of use, I noticed noticed bluetooth audio cutting out periodically which is frustrating and ruins music listening. Despite this, I would still recommend these.P.S buy a case!!! The JBL Vibe Buds case has some fragile corners that chip over time.",

        "review": "For the price, these are great. I like to keep a pair of headphones by my bed to listen to audiobooks or music in bed. I had to replace an old pair of airpods because they wouldn\u2019t hold a charge longer than 30 minutes. My primary focus was battery life. I fall asleep with these JBLs in and in the morning they still have at least half battery after sitting out of the case all night long. Second want for ear buds was something better at noise canceling than airpods (husband snores). These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don\u2019t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it. Only complaint, and this is totally my fault, is that the rubber tips are slightly too large for my ears and they fall out a lot or make my ears sore. But they came with either replacement rubber tips or different sizes in the box when i got them and i threw them away. Since then ive been having a hard time finding generic replacement tips that don\u2019t disrupt the charging on these. But like i said that\u2019s on me. Anyways TL:DR baby best the price, excellent battery life, above average noise cancelling.",

They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3\u2019s.  I\u2019m an audiophile on a budget. They can\u2019t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they\u2019re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I\u2019ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that\u2019s due to the EQ setting I\u2019ve selected.  You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven\u2019t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the \u201cambient-aware\u201d or \u201ctalk through\u201d modes. That\u2019s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don\u2019t seem to have any functional ANC.  I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They\u2019ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1.  However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc.  it\u2019s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don\u2019t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",

He said he only charges them about once a week and uses them for about 3-4 hours a day. He let me use them during the first month our newborn came home and they saved my life since our baby had colic. They are also very compact so they fit inside of his pocket perfectly, even with a case. The bass quality is superb for such little buds too. Definitely worth the price and after a year they havnt lost any quality in sound.",

        "review": "The Good:1. I paid $24 for these back in November of '24 as part of a Black Friday special and am quite happy with the purchase.2. They sound really, really good -- but only when I apply pressure to them, push them into my ears and hold them.3. I dropped one into a sink full of water for two or three seconds (totally submerged). I expected it to die but it still played! (Another time sweat ran down into my ear and conked it out for the evening.)4. The free JBL Headphones app has an equalizer, as well as some other features, which will allow you to make some adjustments to the sound ( I tried it but didn't notice a big difference and ended up uninstalling it to free up memory).5. Some people claim you can mold your own earbud tips and improve the fit and sound quality.The Bad:1. They don't fit snuggly. I tried the different sized rubber ear tips that came with it and none of them are quite right.2. The sound is very thin. This is 100% a fit issue. Shove them in and hold them and they sound really good.3. When the batteries get low you get an audible \"battery is low\" message. Fine but as the battery gets lower, the message eventually stats coming every twenty seconds or so (maybe faster). It's quite annoying.4. Getting them in and out of the case is somewhat of a PITA due to some design issues.",

        "review": "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

        "review": "I've been using these for a few days now and I can honestly say that I really enjoy them. They definitely have their pros and cons as with any earbuds, but the cons stop these from reaching a 5 star rating for me.- Sound Quality: These earbuds sound great in all modes. The audio is crystal clear and you can clearly make out all sounds in a game or all instruments in music. They lean a bit towards being bass-heavy, but you can change that in the app/software that pairs with them. The active noise cancellation isn't as strong as some other options out there, but it's certainly passable.- Mic Quality: The mic is nothing special on these. Your friends/coworkers will be able to make out what you're saying, but the quality is nowhere near that of a headset or dedicated mic.- Battery Life: My biggest complaint is the battery life. On a full charge, they'll go for 3-5 hours. On the bright side, they charge relatively quickly in the case.- Connectivity: Bluetooth and the 2.4 GHz dongle work as you'd expect them to. Bluetooth is notoriously laggy on Windows, so with the dongle, games are actually playable without too much latency. There is still some, but it's miles better than trying to suffer through Bluetooth latency in a game.- Ease of use: The instructions are very clear and helpful, but the controls themselves aren't very obvious or intuitive. I find myself referring to the instruction manual for some of the functions that I use less frequently.I'd say these are absolutely worth it for the sale price of $75, but I can't see myself spending $150 on these. If you're looking for a lower latency 2.4 GHz connection, these are probably the best option out there currently.",

I gave it to my younger brother and got the JBL Tune 2, hoping to have the same experience. The product do have interesting updates, like the noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk-through options. Although I couldn\u2019t feel any difference between the first two, the talk-through option just lowers the volume and keep playing it. However, there are expressive downgrades compared to the first one:1) connection. If you get far away, it disconnects easily. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not expecting to be 30 meters away. However, the same distance I was perfectly able to use it on the first one, now, it completely disconnects.  ALSO IT UNSYNC RANDOMLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PHONE IN FRONT OF YOU. It had happened several times while I am writing this review. Something that was rare, now it happens DAILY2) battery. Although the battery is still very decent, nothing compared to the first one. That I had for almost a year and charged every 3 weeks. This one, I have to charge once a week. The earbuds have a good battery, but the case that charges it doesn\u2019t have as good as the first one.3) connection WHILE CLOSE. I am not sure how the connection is done, but if my phone is in my pocket upside down, the connection gets so unstable that every earbud loses its sync, and every single one starts playing in a different frequency. It\u2019s crazy this happens!!I am very unsatisfied with this product and have been facing these issues since day 1. But waited to see if was going to keep like that or not. I would suggest to get the previous version or another brand earbuds (which I can\u2019t recommend any bc I always preferred JBL due to its battery life)",

I had to buy silicone attachments to make them stay in, but they are uncomfortable and annoying to put on every time I want to use the earbuds. The sound is good and I have always liked JBL earbuds in the past, but the ergonomic design of these is awful.",

        "review": "Day n+1 update:Warning: once you lost the AUX to USB-C cable like me, it's almost no way to buy this cable. Most usb-c to aux cable/converter on the market is DAC included and doesn't work with JBL Tour Case.They bring another firmware update and everything seems more stable and I enjoy it. The sound and convenience do replace all my earphones now: including Sony WH-1000XM4!Except: 1. recently I still got the case reset once.2. ANC is still a tough issue.3. In the meeting, \"heee\" sound when people speaking. And also for phone-call microphone, if you're outside, your speak seems hard to be heard. I'm almost give up to use its microphone.I hope this is the last. Day n update:- The world's easiest auto-reset ear-buds? Every-time it happens I need to forget and re-connect to all my devices. Annoying.- During the meeting, when people speak every sentence, a high-frequency sound I can't really describe keeping happening. Kind of slight \"heee\" sound, kind of annoying.Day 3 Update: I still like to turn on LDAC.Its ANC is indeed a bit strange at times. For example, when I was riding my scooter or walking near a construction area, I noticed some kind of high-frequency knocking sounds.Also, when I wear a raincoat or put up the hood of my hoodie, it keeps accidentally touching the earbuds\u2014almost like it\u2019s happening a thousand times!Day 2 Update:After: 1. Update firmware of earbuds and the case. 2. Use AAC (instead of LDAC) decoding. 3. Disable \"Smart Talk\". Now the battery of earbuds seems to last for 8 hours.What others I didn't expect:Its earbud tips are not as comfortable as those on the Jabra Active 7. When removing them from your ears, there is a sensation of suction, followed by a slight \u201cpop\u201d sound feeling to the ear. Sometimes, this causes the earbud to end up in the wrong orientation, and you have to adjust it by hand to put it back in the correct position.The sound isn't best but better than I expected. I think it's good enough and worth the price together with its other features. 3.5mm connector to Auracast to earbuds is a very important use case to me (and it works).Changing the picture of the case display is interesting after I found a personal and good picture.--- Day 1 review ---I bought these earbuds mainly for the advertised long battery life. However, on the first day of use, with a full 100% charge, they only lasted about 4 hours \u2014 far from the claimed 8 hours and not consistent with what other reviews suggested.Here\u2019s what I experienced:1. The first time I took them out of the charging case, the battery dropped from 100% to 90% in less than ten minutes \u2014 before I even used them.2. When I connected them to my phone (an Android), I noticed they had already been paired with a device named \"iPhone,\" which raises concern that they might be refurbished.",

        "review": "I don't necessarily write reviews. But as someone that has been on the search for the best earbuds. I have owned the bose QC ultras old and new version. Every single pair of apple airpods. And galaxy buds. I also have sonys over ear wxm4s and 5s.But I must say this is the one device that has truly left me feeling like my money was well spent. I have heard sounds in my songs I didn't even know were there. Not to mention I have had no connection issues whatsoever, which coming from bose you know although they sound great (when they work) the connection is absolute DOG water. Wasting over $1000+ on Bose and sony headphones has pushed me to write this review. If you are looking for something worth while and that sounds so absolutely amazing with great noise cancellation these are the pair.I always went back to my airpod pros due to their ease of access, although that's their main selling point the sound is lacking and could use work. These JBLS take the crown for me. Great work JBL will be buying more products from here on out!",

        "review": "These earbuds have very good audio in general, with typical JBL somewhat bass-heavy sound. However, the equalizer function's customizability easily compensates for the coloration. Other features include Ambient Noise Cancelling, spatial audio with optional head tracking, a smart charging case with touchscreen controls for nearly all features, a companion mobile device app with controls for all features, the case can be used as a transmitter to get the sound to the earbuds from non-Bluetooth devices with audio out via USB (A or C) or \u215b inch (3.5 mm) headphone jack, or anything that can be adapted to one of those. Buds are capable of receiving Auracast audio. You can also listen to your tracks in high-resolution LDAC audio at 24 bits & 96 kHz. The only major features that I've seen elsewhere, that the Tour Pro 3 lack is a case that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker or a power bank. But honestly, does anyone really want to carry that extra weight around with the earbuds all the time? I already have a power bank and several Bluetooth speakers. I only carry them around when I reasonably expect to want or need them.However, I found the experience of using the buds for the first time less than satisfying. The main reason for replacing my previous earbuds was declining battery life. But though they were inexpensive (brand 233621, model Zen), they had what I now realize to be excellent broad-spectrum ANC. The Tour Pro 3, in contrast, even at their maximum ANC setting, allow quite a lot of high-frequency noise through that the Zen cancel. This was quite noticeable and annoying while vacuuming the house. I expect better from a flagship product of a well-known brand such as Harman/JBL. If I hadn't gotten them at the Cyber Monday discount with the help of a gift card that covered half the cost I would definitely be returning them and getting something else.I have read elsewhere that the Tour Pro 3's 360 Spatial Audio is also lackluster, but having nothing to compare it to, I can't say much about it. Head tracking seems to work as expected when enabled, moving sounds from center to left or right as I  move my head, but the spatial effect is minimal for me. I'm one of those for whom headphones and earbuds nearly exclusively produce sound that seems to come from inside my head on a line between my ears. Without head tracking, the Tour Pro 3's spatial audio adds fullness and extension so sounds hard-panned left and right (or nearly so) seem to come from outside my head, and those from nearer the center of the stereo image seem to be slightly forward and less sharply defined, but still inside my head. Using headphones or earbuds, I've never heard any effect that made the sounds seem to emanate realistically from somewhere in front of me. It's likely that I never will, just because of how my ears and brain are.Verdict: I'll keep them, but if I had known in advance how weak the Tour Pro 3's ANC was, I would have chosen another brand & model.",

        "review": "These earbuds are the best replacement for my AirPods (RIP) out of the 2 others I\u2019ve tried. The sound quality is really good, they\u2019ve got a good bass response and good clarity so you hear the nuances in music. I\u2019ve tried jazz, classical, post-punk, and R&B music on them and they sound good with those, but I can\u2019t yet say how phone calls sound bc I haven\u2019t tried that yet. Battery life is really long, and the case almost never needs recharging! These are more versatile than the other earbuds I tried. I got them because you can use them with or without the sealing suction cup ear tip thingies. I like them without, because this way (1)they stay in place and don\u2019t work their way loose from my ears every few minutes just like other sealing tip earbuds used to do, they let air through so they don\u2019t make my ears all sweaty and gross, and (2)if something happens that I need to hear, I can pause the music and hear outside of the earbuds without having to fumble with taking the earbuds out. I live in a violent area and I need to be able to hear my surroundings for my own safety. The app is pretty nice, it lets you choose the functions that happen when you tap them, or even disable tapping functions, which I do sometimes so I don\u2019t accidentally skip songs etc. just because I accidentally touched them. It also lets you adjust the EQ with presets or custom settings. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had earbuds with an app and at first I thought it\u2019d be dinky to have an app for my earbuds, but i changed my mind to like it because it works well and you can just set it and forget it. As for reliability, these don\u2019t seem to have the connection issues that people on Reddit reported that they had. Maybe these are an updated model? I\u2019ve had them for about a week and they are behaving just like any normal Bluetooth device. Pretty hassle-free. I\u2019m happy.UPDATE: after just 11 months of light to moderate use, they are doing the thing where one bud\u2019s battery drains from 100% to nothing in 5 minutes, they\u2019re failing to stay disconnected from the phone even when they\u2019re supposed to be charging . Also the case gets stuck charging to only 10%.UPDATE 2: there is a fix for this, after which the earbuds are working well again: you have to stick a few layers of little pieces of tape in the inside of the lid to make it push the buds down harder into the pins when closed, so they both charge (the problem is, the springs for the pins goes bad over time, so they don\u2019t make good contact). Then to clear out the glitches caused by this case fiasco you have to factory reset the buds according to the quick start guide, and then do this: open the JBL app, remove the buds to make them pair to the app, then put them back in the case BUT LEAVE THE LID OPEN, then in the app tap \u201cpower off.\u201d I\u2019ve had no more problems since.",

        "review": "Update after 1.5 years:Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge.  First happened at 6 months.  Exchanged under warranty.  One year later, having the same issue.I have liked them.  They have good sound and are easy to use.  But I would not order them again.  I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models.  Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200.Side note:  JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly.Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from \"low battery\" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

        "review": "As someone who puts a lot of thought into the details that matter to everyday users, the JBL Tune Flex earbuds genuinely impressed me.What really sets these apart is the versatility. The ability to switch between sound pass-through and full noise blocking makes them incredibly adaptable\u2014whether I\u2019m zoning out to a playlist, locking in on an audiobook or podcast, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet without the pressure of removing the earbuds. Comfort is excellent; they\u2019re easy to wear for extended periods without fatigue, which is something many earbuds still get wrong.Audio quality is clean, balanced, and exactly what you\u2019d expect from JBL\u2014reliable and satisfying across different listening styles. Battery life carries me through most of a full workday with consistent use. While I wouldn\u2019t complain about a little extra runtime, it\u2019s far from a dealbreaker and fits well within real-world expectations.Overall, the JBL Tune Flex feels like a thoughtfully designed, daily-driver set of earbuds that delivers where it counts.

        "review": "Quite happy with these. After my beloved Pixel Buds started failing I had a hard time finding something that was a) as secure and comfortable in-ear as the Buds and 2) would allow me to hear ambient sounds like the Buds. These fit the bill just right.They have a little winglet on the earpiece like the Buds, and the same twist-to-lock design. They are quite secure in your ear without being uncomfortable. I thought the size would be an issue, bouncing around or something, but I barely notice them. The size IS an issue when cycling though, as the wind noise they generate is distracting on downhill bits.The battery life is remarkable. After a 50 minute ride I still had 97% battery. Nuts. I bet these would last a full workday.Sound quality is quite good. Vocals are clear and crisp, deep bass hits nicely, though it might be lacking a bit at mids and mid-bass. I'm quite pleased. These would be excellent if you do a lot of podcasts.I didn't want ANC because, again, I want to be aware of my surroundings when I work out, but the Ambient Awareness mode in these does it's advertised job nicely. Full ANC isn't going to be on the level of a Bose Quietcomfort, but it's pretty adequate. Time will tell if these do the job on an airplane. For working out though, I don't WANT a Quietcomfort--I need to have some spacial awareness, and these do that job well.I rate these 9/10 for the job they're designed for (workouts). For the $49 I paid for them, that's remarkable.",

        "review": "I'd rate these 3.5 if that were an option.  I switched to these after years of using similar priced and designed (as far as I can tell) Sony earbuds.The noise cancelling seems a little less pronounced than on similar Sony earbuds I have used (may not be a bad thing) and does not deal with wind noise as well (not a good thing), but overall works pretty well for dampening non-wind background noise.  The overall sound quality is adequate for my main use-cases - listening to podcasts and books and doing phone calls and video conferences. If I were more focused on listening to music, I'd want something better and I think the Sony ones were a bit better.The headphones often disconnect from Bluetooth when I'm walking around; sometimes they reconnect within about 3-7 seconds; other times I need to do this manually.  That is frustrating but quickly solved. I have not had the problem with the JBL headphones that repeatedly occurred with several sets of Sony earbuds I had, where the left earbud would refuse for hours, days or \"forever' to connect to Bluetooth. Repeatedly facing that issue with several iterations of Sony earbuds (which I otherwise liked and think were better than these JBL earbuds) is what caused me to give up on Sony and give JBL a try.The headphones stay in my ears during exercise and through sweating and bouncing around.

The noise cancellation was so effective I could keep my volume lower and my ears feel much better.

I walk in the gym, it's loud in there (big chain gym). Once I turn on the noise cancellation (I use the functional training setting) WHOOSH, all of a sudden, all I can hear is my music. It's incredible. And these things can hold a charge like nothing else. They are very sweat proof. The sound quality is amazing, my music sounds so much better on these than my old earbuds. Getting a fit was easy and they stay in place all workout long, whether I'm lifting, on the elliptical or even doing aerobics. I love the customizable controls for taps. Everything about these is customizable! And they are also ready out of the box. Truly a great investment. With the noise cancelling I can keep the volume lower and it makes my ears feel much better. I do recommend if it's your first time with active noise cancelling (ANC), read up on what it does first. There's a good NYT article on it. All I can hear in the gym with ANC on full is clanking from weights, which is high frequency sound. The low frequency roar of treadmills and the vacuum them are always running is gone once I turn ANC on. Highly recommend, absolutely love them and a great value for the money.",

        "review": "First Thing: UPDATE these ear buds. You need to do it TWICE! Get the JBL app for your phone and software update the buds, then get the JBL Quantum Engine App for PC (or Mac) and do the firmware update. Before the updates I could only get one bud/channel to work with Android using the dongle, and after the updates both buds work. So far I have tested the USB-C Dongle with PC, Steam Deck, iPad, and Android - it works well with all devices listed providing low latency, and high(er) fidelity, sound. I tested multiple games on Steam Deck, including Hi-Fi Rush (a rhythm game), and had no latency issues. The Dongle is true plug and play (no setup needed) on every device except PC. Plugging in the USB-C Dongle prompted a download of Quantum Engine, and inside the QE app you can set EQ and tweak the Surround Sound settings. I tested the buds in Battlefield V on PC and the surround sound worked well. Adjusting the EQ in the QE app on PC is easy and necessary in order to get the most pleasing sound. The only device I\u2019m using Bluetooth with is my Android phone and the sound is fine - use the JBL app to adjust the EQ. The Android App offers a FULL EQ, not the typical/lame EQ for dummies a lot of ear bud devices ship with.I\u2019ve only had the JBL Quantum TWS Airs (that name lol) for a short time, so I can\u2019t offer a comprehensive review yet. I will say they are very light and fit well in my ears. There is no wing, or stabilizer, so these might not be great for active on-the-go situations. The stock EQ needed a tweak for my ears, and the Apps make that easy. The sound quality via the USB-C Dongle is a noticeable upgrade in terms of latency and fidelity. These are better for music than I anticipated, and from reviews I read this is one of the big differences from the more expensive, and older version, of this line of Quantum TWS buds. Battery life is much shorter using the Dongle, and that makes sense as the low latency signal is more power hungry than Bluetooth. I spent some time looking for low latency wireless ear buds and this is one the most affordable options out there ($40 on sale). Hopefully in time more companies will offer similar low latency earbuds, or maybe Bluetooth will get good enough to make a product like this irrelevant.",

        "review": "They have an excellent sound quality, the ANC works pretty well and it's also adaptative, I'm not a fan of a talk-through function I think it's best to just pause your music.The headphones are pretty comfortable and fit perfectly for my ear, the battery life is very good too. The case is a little too big for carrying it on a pocket but still can fit. It charges pretty fast too and I appreciate that.The voice assistant is very useful, it can read and answer message and read u all your notifications. Also control smart home devices which I use a lot.Only problem with it is that the dongle doesn't work very well with other smartphones or tablets, I read that the Pc firmware update can fix that but my Pc doesn't have a usb-c port and I haven't been able to buy an adapter (and it can't connect to the pc app by Bluetooth for some reason).Definitely a good purchase still just for it's in-app customization, voice assistant features and sound quality.",

        "review": "So I bought these earbuds on discount for $75 on Black Friday, and I want to share some thoughts I have about this thing.1. It's not exactly perfectly low latency. I play rhythm games a lot, and I do notice a slight amount of latency even with the \"low latency\" dongle mode. I've tried disabling any audio processing on Windows, but it's still the same. The latency is fairly low given that it's wireless. You'll be hard pressed to notice for other games like Valorant, but there's just a touch of latency which prevents me from using it for rhythm games in particular.2. Audio is pretty good. Very bass heavy as you'd expect, but there is an EQ so you can change it around. Once you balance it out with the EQ I think the audio quality is quite exceptional for these buds.3. Battery life is mid. When you use it in low-latency mode the battery dies in around 3-4 hours without ANC or processing. Probably take off an hour if you had it on. The bluetooth mode lasts for much longer, I'd peg it around 6 hours (although I've never fully drained it in bluetooth yet).4. Charging is fairly fast for both the case and the earbuds.5. There are some strange audio artifacts (glitching and occasionally choppy audio) with the dongle. This happens very occasionally, and I've tried disabling interference like from Wi-Fi and other 2.4Ghz accessories but it still occurs.6. I think the touch controls are hard to learn. The one for switching modes is fairly straightforward, but pairing, switching, and learning play/pause is not intuitive.7. Noise cancellation is quite weak compared to many other earbuds on the market, similar with the \"transparency mode\" on these things. Talk-thru actually is OK, but sounds artificial and you can definitely tell the noise from outside is piped in.8. They sit comfortably in the ears and don't feel like they're gonna fall out. However, at least for me, they get uncomfortable over like 1 hour of wearing.Overall, given the discounted $75 price I think they're a great pair of buds, better than other $99 Bluetooth buds on the market. At the original $150, there are much better options (without low latency dongle).And gamers beware, if you are planning to use these for latency critical audio tasks, these are NOT for you. Stick to wired or look for something else. These get quite close but I still notice a tad bit of audio latency.",

        "review": "i used my last pair for five years, i think it was. the first thing that went was the charging - they didn't charge in the case. so i had to charge the earbuds by charging the case. then the case didn't charge as well anymore. then the battery of the earbuds declined so i only had maybe an hour of noise cancellation, which is my primary reason for using these. then they stopped pairing so well, and then ultimately one earbud stopped working altogether. so i bought another pair! these are worth buying when they're on sale the two times a year they go on sale. camelcamelcamel.com can tell you exactly by copying and pasting their URL.these have the best sound quality ever. the bass is AMAZING and makes all the difference for me. the other aspects of the quality are also incredible and the noise cancellation is the best i've tried so far. would definitely recommend - and have! my dad bought them as well, and he's very very picky about comfort. he always complains about how they fit in his ears. but he likes these and he is willing to work out with them as well.",

After about an hour or so, my ears will start to get sore, but it's not too bad. They do cut out for about 1 sec maybe every 20 mins or so, but for the price I paid, I'm still pretty happy with them.I had not had a chance to really compare them with others until recently. We bought my dad for his birthday the Sony WF-1000XM5. They are double the price of these JBLs. He was having trouble with them so I took them for a week to find out what he was doing wrong (nothing was wrong - he wasn't wearing them correctly). While I was testing them, didn't cut out, and the sound, comfort, ambient aware and noise cancelling features were incredible. Sony's were 10x better than the JBLs.Bottom line: If you want a decent pair of noise cancelling earbuds without paying a fortune, I do believe, for the price, these JBLs are still a good buy. I liked being able to finally compare them, though, to another brand. Hope this helps.Previous post:I am super impressed with the noise canceling on these earbuds. I was looking for earbuds that had a good balance of comfort and noise cancelling and decent sound. With all the earbuds I have bought in the past I never found ones that were good at canceling the loud noise of plane engines when flying and I was always turning the sound up super loud just to hear the music.

I wanted waterproof so I could listen to my books or music in the shower as I got ready in the morning, but I have to remember to change the tapping settings (pause, skip, volume, Siri, etc) to off before or else EVERY water drop will cause it to do something. ANYTHING that brushes the side of the device while wearing it causes it to do something, usually pausing it for me, but if it brushes back AND forth, it may skip ahead. It\u2019s just annoying. Whatever. Still better than most because I have the OPTION of using in water. And it still works after without sounding wonky (if your ears are dry; putting them INTO wet ears make them slippery and sound weird out of shower).I am buying another set because I lost one of them rushing upstairs to wake up my kids for a tornado siren (false alarm). Since they are fairly cheap, I don\u2019t even mind just replacing it.  The lost feature is pretty worthless-if it\u2019s dead (or out of range?), it will tell you it can\u2019t be found, not last known location or last time used\u2026Nothing helpful. I had to wait until after work to look, and it must have been drained by then.It charges quick; but it\u2019s annoying when it keeps beeping (or speaking: battery low) to remind me. I wish I could limit reminders so it would just stop playing after a warning. I like falling asleep to a book and the beep or voice prompt abruptly wakes me up/stops that process unnecessarily.",

The wireless headphones stay charged for a very long duration. There are a little pricey but worth the money. They fit well in my ears. However, after a few hours, the extra rubber piece that gives it a better hold to the ear, starts to cause pain. So I\u2019m not able to wear and use them for a long time period. I\u2019ve been impressed with the design until recently. A piece that covers the plastic ear tip has come out. Which has made it collect dust down inside the earbud. They are very hard to clean once the ear rubber size is taken off, especially if there is dust or a little bit of ear wax.I would still recommend and buy again.

        "review": "I purchased these on three different occasions. The first pair I purchased in December, 2023 were great!! I workout quite consistently and heavily and sweat a lot. The first pair continued to deliver great sound and remain in my ear even during the most intense of workout sessions.Sadly, I lost my first pair two months after buying them (my fault) and purchased a second pair without hesitation. The second pair held up well until after a while they didn't. After a couple of years, one ear went bad until both earbuds eventually didn't produce any sound regardless of how charged they were. No big deal. I chalked it up as it being time to replace them.In May, 2025, I purchased a brand new third set. I don't know what happened in two years since the purchase of the first/second sets or if this set was just malfunctioned, but these buds could not handle my workouts. Sweat would cause one earbud (mainly the right one) to clog and not produce any sound and the sound quality of the other earbud was horrible. The volume would go very low (even with the volume turned all the way up) and the sound was garbled. UGGGHHHH!!! So disappointing!!! I dealt with them like this for three months holding out hope that these were just rare instances that would eventually correct over time. No such luck! Also the buds would loosen from my ears and slowly slide out of position (sometimes falling out). To remedy this I would wear bandanas to help hold them in place. SO ANNOYING!!I just don't want to deal with this anymore, so into the drawer of used and dead electronic items it goes along with the old cell phones, non-working chargers, and the second pair of lame JBL Race earbuds.

I expected it to die but it still played! (Another time sweat ran down into my ear and conked it out for the evening.)4. The free JBL Headphones app has an equalizer, as well as some other features, which will allow you to make some adjustments to the sound ( I tried it but didn't notice a big difference and ended up uninstalling it to free up memory).5. Some people claim you can mold your own earbud tips and improve the fit and sound quality.The Bad:1. They don't fit snuggly. I tried the different sized rubber ear tips that came with it and none of them are quite right.2. The sound is very thin. This is 100% a fit issue. Shove them in and hold them and they sound really good.3. When the batteries get low you get an audible \"battery is low\" message. Fine but as the battery gets lower, the message eventually stats coming every twenty seconds or so (maybe faster). It's quite annoying.4.

        "review": "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used.

        "review": "i used my last pair for five years, i think it was. the first thing that went was the charging - they didn't charge in the case. so i had to charge the earbuds by charging the case. then the case didn't charge as well anymore. then the battery of the earbuds declined so i only had maybe an hour of noise cancellation, which is my primary reason for using these. then they stopped pairing so well, and then ultimately one earbud stopped working altogether. so i bought another pair! these are worth buying when they're on sale the two times a year they go on sale. camelcamelcamel.com can tell you exactly by copying and pasting their URL.these have the best sound quality ever. the bass is AMAZING and makes all the difference for me. the other aspects of the quality are also incredible and the noise cancellation is the best i've tried so far. would definitely recommend - and have! my dad bought them as well, and he's very very picky about comfort. he always complains about how they fit in his ears. but he likes these and he is willing to work out with them as well.",

After about an hour or so, my ears will start to get sore, but it's not too bad. They do cut out for about 1 sec maybe every 20 mins or so, but for the price I paid, I'm still pretty happy with them.I had not had a chance to really compare them with others until recently. We bought my dad for his birthday the Sony WF-1000XM5. They are double the price of these JBLs. He was having trouble with them so I took them for a week to find out what he was doing wrong (nothing was wrong - he wasn't wearing them correctly). While I was testing them, didn't cut out, and the sound, comfort, ambient aware and noise cancelling features were incredible. Sony's were 10x better than the JBLs.Bottom line: If you want a decent pair of noise cancelling earbuds without paying a fortune, I do believe, for the price, these JBLs are still a good buy. I liked being able to finally compare them, though, to another brand. Hope this helps.Previous post:I am super impressed with the noise canceling on these earbuds. I was looking for earbuds that had a good balance of comfort and noise cancelling and decent sound. With all the earbuds I have bought in the past I never found ones that were good at canceling the loud noise of plane engines when flying and I was always turning the sound up super loud just to hear the music. These earbuds are comfortable and did a fantastic job of canceling the background noise. I also really like the \"ambient aware\" function that allows me to turn off the noise canceling when my wife was talking next to me on the plane and I didn't have to take the earbuds out to hear her. I'm not an expert by any means, but I feel these $100 earbuds cancel out noise as well as some of the other more pricey $200-300+ over the ear brands I have played around with in stores that are big and bulky to carry around. The case is small and can fit in my pocket easily, and I can charge them while in my pocket. So when I have a layover flight, by time I got these out at my next flight gate or on the plane, they're ready to go. And I found them on sale on here for $50, which made it even better! I haven't tried these for working out or running yet so I can't say how they are with sweating and such. But for the casual wearer who would use them for something like traveling, these are DEFINITELY worth it! I highly recommend them.",

        "review": "I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldn\u2019t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they\u2019re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds.  Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3\u2019s.  I\u2019m an audiophile on a budget. They can\u2019t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they\u2019re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I\u2019ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that\u2019s due to the EQ setting I\u2019ve selected.  You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven\u2019t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the \u201cambient-aware\u201d or \u201ctalk through\u201d modes. That\u2019s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don\u2019t seem to have any functional ANC.  I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They\u2019ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1.  However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc.  it\u2019s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don\u2019t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",

They would barely work with Apple products, and they'd work okay with Microsoft products. I submitted for an exchange or refund WITHIN DAYS OF RECEIVING THEM, and Amazon rejected both. I then contacted JBL and started the process over. I very clearly explained that I had done all of the trouble shooting possible. I was told to try the troubleshooting again, as there was no other option. I told them I wasn't going to waste my time, and that they needed to make it right. I got no reply.A week later I got an email requesting a review of my service, HILARIOUS. I let them know I received a defective product and was ignored by both Amazon and JBL. I told them you're welcome for the free money.I immediately got a reply apologizing and information to return the defective products, as well as a tracking number for the replacement pair.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues, although not as severely. I decided to keep them because wasn't interesting in spending more time begging to get what I'm owed. Aside from the audio issues, the casing on these have begun to chip off. These headphones sit on my desk all day. They do not get jostled inside of a bag or moved around whatsoever.I've had these second pair almost a year, and now they work even less then the original pair did. I'm going to go to the gas station and buy a $5 pair, drive over them with my car a few times, and they'll still sound better and be more durable than these earbuds ever did.JBL, I never wanted to talk to you again, but you're about to hear from me.

I fall asleep with these JBLs in and in the morning they still have at least half battery after sitting out of the case all night long. Second want for ear buds was something better at noise canceling than airpods (husband snores). These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don\u2019t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it. Only complaint, and this is totally my fault, is that the rubber tips are slightly too large for my ears and they fall out a lot or make my ears sore. But they came with either replacement rubber tips or different sizes in the box when i got them and i threw them away. Since then ive been having a hard time finding generic replacement tips that don\u2019t disrupt the charging on these. But like i said that\u2019s on me.

        "review": "Incredible ear buds. I\u2019ve purchased a ton of Soundcore stuff recently for their features and varieties and a long history of Apple AirPods and Beats studios, Monster, etc. Ear buds were basically a disposable thing to pop into my ears. I found that none of the soundcore variety stayed in my ears all too well which is a big deal since active noise cancelling (ANC) is a frequently sought out industry standard. Plus, no one seems to be able to hear me when I use them. Oh and I had one of there over the ear headphones, Q40s or something? Sounded great, ANC was impressive. Fell off my head once, and cracked. What a waste.So I decide to spend slightly more money and took advantage of a Black Friday sale. $150 later and some homework: I was looking to the Tour Pro 2s and 3s and found that the Live Beam 3s were meant to replace the Tour 2s, I decided to give these a try.First off, they\u2019re a bit larger in the main housing so they snug to my ear better unconditional of the silicone tip size. Once I selected the smaller silicone tip, it was the most accurate fit I\u2019ve had to date of anything I\u2019ve tried in ear. Even better? Download the app and it will detect how effective your seal is. WHAT!I\u2019m an audiophile in that I like good sounding music and that I believe very few thing will ever beat the organic sound of vinyl, but I won\u2019t tell you why you need to hear a wider spectrum than 20hz to 20Khz - sorry. But they sound amazing. It\u2019s full. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s bright.Features. Features. Features. I think these have definitely set a standard in UI controlled feature set. The app is touted as one of the best and most of the feature you will frequent the app for you can do right on the cases\u2019 built in screen. So friggin\u2019 cool.People have argued that the ANC allows some noise to bleed through and although I understand where they\u2019re coming from I find it to be 97% acceptable. I don\u2019t expect to have padded room mind bending silence and I don\u2019t know what I would do with that kind of isolation. The ambient mode allows me to keep my buds in and still not be anti social. There a cool smart talk feature that when you begin to talk it can set a period where it switches immediately to an ambient talk through mode so you can maintain your interaction interruption free.

After about an hour or so, my ears will start to get sore, but it's not too bad. They do cut out for about 1 sec maybe every 20 mins or so, but for the price I paid, I'm still pretty happy with them.I had not had a chance to really compare them with others until recently. We bought my dad for his birthday the Sony WF-1000XM5. They are double the price of these JBLs. He was having trouble with them so I took them for a week to find out what he was doing wrong (nothing was wrong - he wasn't wearing them correctly). While I was testing them, didn't cut out, and the sound, comfort, ambient aware and noise cancelling features were incredible. Sony's were 10x better than the JBLs.Bottom line: If you want a decent pair of noise cancelling earbuds without paying a fortune, I do believe, for the price, these JBLs are still a good buy. I liked being able to finally compare them, though, to another brand. Hope this helps.Previous post:I am super impressed with the noise canceling on these earbuds. I was looking for earbuds that had a good balance of comfort and noise cancelling and decent sound. With all the earbuds I have bought in the past I never found ones that were good at canceling the loud noise of plane engines when flying and I was always turning the sound up super loud just to hear the music. These earbuds are comfortable and did a fantastic job of canceling the background noise. I also really like the \"ambient aware\" function that allows me to turn off the noise canceling when my wife was talking next to me on the plane and I didn't have to take the earbuds out to hear her. I'm not an expert by any means, but I feel these $100 earbuds cancel out noise as well as some of the other more pricey $200-300+ over the ear brands I have played around with in stores that are big and bulky to carry around. The case is small and can fit in my pocket easily, and I can charge them while in my pocket. So when I have a layover flight, by time I got these out at my next flight gate or on the plane, they're ready to go. And I found them on sale on here for $50, which made it even better! I haven't tried these for working out or running yet so I can't say how they are with sweating and such. But for the casual wearer who would use them for something like traveling, these are DEFINITELY worth it! I highly recommend them.",

I wouldn\u2019t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they\u2019re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds.  Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3\u2019s.  I\u2019m an audiophile on a budget. They can\u2019t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they\u2019re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I\u2019ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that\u2019s due to the EQ setting I\u2019ve selected.  You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven\u2019t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the \u201cambient-aware\u201d or \u201ctalk through\u201d modes. That\u2019s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don\u2019t seem to have any functional ANC.  I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They\u2019ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1.  However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc.  it\u2019s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don\u2019t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",

For me I have to use the larger included ear tips or else it just feels too loose and I like more of an in-ear fit. The Flex 2 with the large ear tips have the best fitment, again \u201cfor me\u201d. Which is surprising to me because I was the most skeptical about these. The Buds 2 had terrible fitment, and the Beam 2\u2019s sealed fine on my right ear, but it would fall out sometimes on my left ear. Beam 2 also had a lot of problems when trying to use them for calls. To really get the best out of these you definitely need to use the JBL app. Try messing around with the EQ. I put up a picture of what someone else did and made my own. I know it looks weird, but it really works well. So far I\u2019m happy with these. I will update if any issues arise.",

Noise cancelling is not bad at this price point, ambient aware works well and allows you to hear around you while still listening to your music. The Talk through mode is great, just double tap the left bud and it's like they aren't even in your ears. I'm very happy with the performance. Battery life is solid with the charging case. Case is compact with a rounded shape, so easy carry in your pocket. No wireless charging but not a deal breaker for me.",

        "review": "I waited a couple months to give my honest, accurate and sad review.I had the JBL Tune Flex 1 for months and was amazing. I gave it to my younger brother and got the JBL Tune 2, hoping to have the same experience. The product do have interesting updates, like the noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk-through options. Although I couldn\u2019t feel any difference between the first two, the talk-through option just lowers the volume and keep playing it. However, there are expressive downgrades compared to the first one:1) connection. If you get far away, it disconnects easily. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not expecting to be 30 meters away. However, the same distance I was perfectly able to use it on the first one, now, it completely disconnects.  ALSO IT UNSYNC RANDOMLY EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PHONE IN FRONT OF YOU. It had happened several times while I am writing this review. Something that was rare, now it happens DAILY2) battery. Although the battery is still very decent, nothing compared to the first one. That I had for almost a year and charged every 3 weeks. This one, I have to charge once a week. The earbuds have a good battery, but the case that charges it doesn\u2019t have as good as the first one.3) connection WHILE CLOSE. I am not sure how the connection is done, but if my phone is in my pocket upside down, the connection gets so unstable that every earbud loses its sync, and every single one starts playing in a different frequency. It\u2019s crazy this happens!!I am very unsatisfied with this product and have been facing these issues since day 1. But waited to see if was going to keep like that or not. I would suggest to get the previous version or another brand earbuds (which I can\u2019t recommend any bc I always preferred JBL due to its battery life)",

        "review": "Day n+1 update:Warning: once you lost the AUX to USB-C cable like me, it's almost no way to buy this cable. Most usb-c to aux cable/converter on the market is DAC included and doesn't work with JBL Tour Case.They bring another firmware update and everything seems more stable and I enjoy it. The sound and convenience do replace all my earphones now: including Sony WH-1000XM4!Except: 1. recently I still got the case reset once.2. ANC is still a tough issue.3. In the meeting, \"heee\" sound when people speaking. And also for phone-call microphone, if you're outside, your speak seems hard to be heard. I'm almost give up to use its microphone.I hope this is the last. Day n update:- The world's easiest auto-reset ear-buds? Every-time it happens I need to forget and re-connect to all my devices. Annoying.- During the meeting, when people speak every sentence, a high-frequency sound I can't really describe keeping happening. Kind of slight \"heee\" sound, kind of annoying.Day 3 Update: I still like to turn on LDAC.Its ANC is indeed a bit strange at times. For example, when I was riding my scooter or walking near a construction area, I noticed some kind of high-frequency knocking sounds.Also, when I wear a raincoat or put up the hood of my hoodie, it keeps accidentally touching the earbuds\u2014almost like it\u2019s happening a thousand times!Day 2 Update:After: 1. Update firmware of earbuds and the case. 2. Use AAC (instead of LDAC) decoding. 3. Disable \"Smart Talk\". Now the battery of earbuds seems to last for 8 hours.What others I didn't expect:Its earbud tips are not as comfortable as those on the Jabra Active 7. When removing them from your ears, there is a sensation of suction, followed by a slight \u201cpop\u201d sound feeling to the ear. Sometimes, this causes the earbud to end up in the wrong orientation, and you have to adjust it by hand to put it back in the correct position.The sound isn't best but better than I expected. I think it's good enough and worth the price together with its other features. 3.5mm connector to Auracast to earbuds is a very important use case to me (and it works).Changing the picture of the case display is interesting after I found a personal and good picture.--- Day 1 review ---I bought these earbuds mainly for the advertised long battery life. However, on the first day of use, with a full 100% charge, they only lasted about 4 hours \u2014 far from the claimed 8 hours and not consistent with what other reviews suggested.Here\u2019s what I experienced:1. The first time I took them out of the charging case, the battery dropped from 100% to 90% in less than ten minutes \u2014 before I even used them.2. When I connected them to my phone (an Android), I noticed they had already been paired with a device named \"iPhone,\" which raises concern that they might be refurbished.",

I have heard sounds in my songs I didn't even know were there. Not to mention I have had no connection issues whatsoever, which coming from bose you know although they sound great (when they work) the connection is absolute DOG water.

If you are looking for something worth while and that sounds so absolutely amazing with great noise cancellation these are the pair.I always went back to my airpod pros due to their ease of access, although that's their main selling point the sound is lacking and could use work.

        "review": "These earbuds have very good audio in general, with typical JBL somewhat bass-heavy sound. However, the equalizer function's customizability easily compensates for the coloration. Other features include Ambient Noise Cancelling, spatial audio with optional head tracking, a smart charging case with touchscreen controls for nearly all features, a companion mobile device app with controls for all features, the case can be used as a transmitter to get the sound to the earbuds from non-Bluetooth devices with audio out via USB (A or C) or \u215b inch (3.5 mm) headphone jack, or anything that can be adapted to one of those. Buds are capable of receiving Auracast audio. You can also listen to your tracks in high-resolution LDAC audio at 24 bits & 96 kHz. The only major features that I've seen elsewhere, that the Tour Pro 3 lack is a case that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker or a power bank. But honestly, does anyone really want to carry that extra weight around with the earbuds all the time? I already have a power bank and several Bluetooth speakers. I only carry them around when I reasonably expect to want or need them.However, I found the experience of using the buds for the first time less than satisfying. The main reason for replacing my previous earbuds was declining battery life. But though they were inexpensive (brand 233621, model Zen), they had what I now realize to be excellent broad-spectrum ANC. The Tour Pro 3, in contrast, even at their maximum ANC setting, allow quite a lot of high-frequency noise through that the Zen cancel. This was quite noticeable and annoying while vacuuming the house. I expect better from a flagship product of a well-known brand such as Harman/JBL. If I hadn't gotten them at the Cyber Monday discount with the help of a gift card that covered half the cost I would definitely be returning them and getting something else.I have read elsewhere that the Tour Pro 3's 360 Spatial Audio is also lackluster, but having nothing to compare it to, I can't say much about it. Head tracking seems to work as expected when enabled, moving sounds from center to left or right as I  move my head, but the spatial effect is minimal for me. I'm one of those for whom headphones and earbuds nearly exclusively produce sound that seems to come from inside my head on a line between my ears. Without head tracking, the Tour Pro 3's spatial audio adds fullness and extension so sounds hard-panned left and right (or nearly so) seem to come from outside my head, and those from nearer the center of the stereo image seem to be slightly forward and less sharply defined, but still inside my head. Using headphones or earbuds, I've never heard any effect that made the sounds seem to emanate realistically from somewhere in front of me. It's likely that I never will, just because of how my ears and brain are.Verdict: I'll keep them, but if I had known in advance how weak the Tour Pro 3's ANC was, I would have chosen another brand & model.",

        "review": "These earbuds are the best replacement for my AirPods (RIP) out of the 2 others I\u2019ve tried. The sound quality is really good, they\u2019ve got a good bass response and good clarity so you hear the nuances in music. I\u2019ve tried jazz, classical, post-punk, and R&B music on them and they sound good with those, but I can\u2019t yet say how phone calls sound bc I haven\u2019t tried that yet. Battery life is really long, and the case almost never needs recharging! These are more versatile than the other earbuds I tried. I got them because you can use them with or without the sealing suction cup ear tip thingies. I like them without, because this way (1)they stay in place and don\u2019t work their way loose from my ears every few minutes just like other sealing tip earbuds used to do, they let air through so they don\u2019t make my ears all sweaty and gross, and (2)if something happens that I need to hear, I can pause the music and hear outside of the earbuds without having to fumble with taking the earbuds out. I live in a violent area and I need to be able to hear my surroundings for my own safety. The app is pretty nice, it lets you choose the functions that happen when you tap them, or even disable tapping functions, which I do sometimes so I don\u2019t accidentally skip songs etc. just because I accidentally touched them. It also lets you adjust the EQ with presets or custom settings. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had earbuds with an app and at first I thought it\u2019d be dinky to have an app for my earbuds, but i changed my mind to like it because it works well and you can just set it and forget it. As for reliability, these don\u2019t seem to have the connection issues that people on Reddit reported that they had. Maybe these are an updated model? I\u2019ve had them for about a week and they are behaving just like any normal Bluetooth device. Pretty hassle-free. I\u2019m happy.UPDATE: after just 11 months of light to moderate use, they are doing the thing where one bud\u2019s battery drains from 100% to nothing in 5 minutes, they\u2019re failing to stay disconnected from the phone even when they\u2019re supposed to be charging . Also the case gets stuck charging to only 10%.UPDATE 2: there is a fix for this, after which the earbuds are working well again: you have to stick a few layers of little pieces of tape in the inside of the lid to make it push the buds down harder into the pins when closed, so they both charge (the problem is, the springs for the pins goes bad over time, so they don\u2019t make good contact). Then to clear out the glitches caused by this case fiasco you have to factory reset the buds according to the quick start guide, and then do this: open the JBL app, remove the buds to make them pair to the app, then put them back in the case BUT LEAVE THE LID OPEN, then in the app tap \u201cpower off.\u201d I\u2019ve had no more problems since.",

        "review": "Update after 1.5 years:Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge.  First happened at 6 months.  Exchanged under warranty.  One year later, having the same issue.I have liked them.  They have good sound and are easy to use.  But I would not order them again.  I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models.  Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200.Side note:  JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly.Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from \"low battery\" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

I wanted waterproof so I could listen to my books or music in the shower as I got ready in the morning, but I have to remember to change the tapping settings (pause, skip, volume, Siri, etc) to off before or else EVERY water drop will cause it to do something. ANYTHING that brushes the side of the device while wearing it causes it to do something, usually pausing it for me, but if it brushes back AND forth, it may skip ahead. It\u2019s just annoying. Whatever. Still better than most because I have the OPTION of using in water. And it still works after without sounding wonky (if your ears are dry; putting them INTO wet ears make them slippery and sound weird out of shower).I am buying another set because I lost one of them rushing upstairs to wake up my kids for a tornado siren (false alarm). Since they are fairly cheap, I don\u2019t even mind just replacing it.  The lost feature is pretty worthless-if it\u2019s dead (or out of range?), it will tell you it can\u2019t be found, not last known location or last time used\u2026Nothing helpful. I had to wait until after work to look, and it must have been drained by then.It charges quick; but it\u2019s annoying when it keeps beeping (or speaking: battery low) to remind me.

        "review": "The Good:1. I paid $24 for these back in November of '24 as part of a Black Friday special and am quite happy with the purchase.2. They sound really, really good -- but only when I apply pressure to them, push them into my ears and hold them.3. I dropped one into a sink full of water for two or three seconds (totally submerged). I expected it to die but it still played! (Another time sweat ran down into my ear and conked it out for the evening.)4. The free JBL Headphones app has an equalizer, as well as some other features, which will allow you to make some adjustments to the sound ( I tried it but didn't notice a big difference and ended up uninstalling it to free up memory).5. Some people claim you can mold your own earbud tips and improve the fit and sound quality.The Bad:1. They don't fit snuggly. I tried the different sized rubber ear tips that came with it and none of them are quite right.2. The sound is very thin. This is 100% a fit issue. Shove them in and hold them and they sound really good.3. When the batteries get low you get an audible \"battery is low\" message. Fine but as the battery gets lower, the message eventually stats coming every twenty seconds or so (maybe faster). It's quite annoying.4. Getting them in and out of the case is somewhat of a PITA due to some design issues.",

        "review": "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

        "review": "Pros:Great headphones, sound is awesome, Bass is good. All of this is adjustable to some degree in the app. Fit is great, I use them at work, at the gym running, working out ect. Price is hard to beat.Cons:If you have the Noise Cancelling on i cannot get 8 hours of use before they need a charge. If you look carefully, just after the \"40 hours of use\" there is a note that this is if NC is off, that may be true, testing this now.Overall:Great earbuds. I love the JBL line and these for the cost are a great product.",

        "review": "These are really excellent for sound quality and have a good bass response. The only drawback (and it's a very small drawback) is the noise canceling is not quite as good as on my last pair of these. It's still acceptable though. For example, I have a soft top jeep and the ANC feature doesn't quite drown out the wind noise. To end the review these are an excellent product for the price point.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "These are my favorite JBL earphones I\u2019ve had! They\u2019re even better when you use the JBL app to customize your hearing experience. The noise cancellation feature is 10/10 & I love the wireless charging capability. The charging case is compact & lightweight. They\u2019re better than Apple Beats & more affordable. Although I wish the pink ones were overnight-able, the black ones I purchased are still aesthetically pleasing.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

So when I have a layover flight, by time I got these out at my next flight gate or on the plane, they're ready to go. And I found them on sale on here for $50, which made it even better! I haven't tried these for working out or running yet so I can't say how they are with sweating and such.
