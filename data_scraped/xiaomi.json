They are a simple baseline model with less frills than the more expensive options such as the Pro2s. That being said they sound fantastic. The app is easy to navigate and makes them extra customizable. Battery life is fantastic. Honestly I'm completely impressed with the CMF 2a series. For a set of base model true wireless buds they lack nothing essential for music lovers. Nice build quality, stylish color optiins, and they sound awesome from the crisp clear highs down to the punchy bass filled lows.Overall a really great product that performs well for the price tag. Judging from these I'm willing to now possibly consider adding a set of Pros or choosing other CMF product purchases in the future.",

        "review": "Should you buy these? Yes.First of all, these are an incredible value, even though I'm not sure what the actual price is. I bought a pair today for $30, curious about how well these perform despite being so cheap, considering how well-liked they are.  I tested them on a set of tracks that are unbalanced, each in their own way (e.g. too heavy on the bass/treble/etc.) and somehow they all sounded good.  I don't know how that's even possible.  These little things have bass you can feel, which I've never experienced with any kind of earbud.  It's not something that I particularly enjoy, but a lot of people will, and it's impressive nevertheless.  When I like a pair of headphones I get a backup pair, so I just bought another pair of these and they were only $20.  After I bought them they went up to $40.  All of those prices are justifiable for the quality these provide, but I am very confused why the price keeps changing on me.But let's say they're supposed to be $40.  At that price point, you wouldn't think to compare them to Sony's WF-1000XM4 or Apple's Airpods Pro 2, but they sound better than both.  It's not that hard to sound better than Airpods, but there are other features worth comparing.  Sounding better than Sony's WF-1000XM4s, however\u2014at somewhere between 6.75% and 13.5% of the cost\u2014is pretty incredible.  Granted, they're definitely not more realistic, but these somehow manage to make everything sound good.  Senheiser's IE 600s are for realism, but I would not argue that they sound better.  When you're listening for fun, the CMF Buds 2a are the most fun.  Normally, I prefer uncolored, realistic sound even in a headphone I use for fun, but these are a rare exception.I love trying new headphones because you get to hear your favorite music in a new way.  Sometimes it's not a huge difference, but I hear more detail than average so I enjoy the subtle stuff.  I think the sound stage of these buds elevate the sound significantly.  You can really hear the details, even in a bad mix. You can hear the sound move so well and with such fluidity.  It's just hard to believe these are $20-40 Bluetooth headphones.I've used these for only a couple of hours now, so I can't speak to battery life, but I'm hoping they truly will make it through the workday.  They're surprisingly comfortable, and the medium tips actually fit great (usually I'm a small size). I like the design. Everything's plastic\u2014and not plastic that feels particularly sturdy\u2014but the design is nice.  While the headphones feel like they go into the case backwards (to me, at least), they snap in thanks to magnets and look nicer in that \"backwards\" position.  The case is very small and looks nice in a minimal way. The active noise canceling is good and comparable to the WF-1000XM4s.  I think the AirPods Pro 2 win in the ANC category by a hair.If there's one place I can fault these buds is in the touch controls.  I can turn ANC on and off, but so far I haven't been sucessful with any other option.  They just don't seem to respond well to taps.  I don't really care, though.  I find touch controls useful only when I can't control the volume and track through any other mechanism.  I find it much easier to make these adjustments on my phone or computer.  Still, I would prefer if I could get the touch controls to actually work.These buds are my new recommendation for non-audiophiles, and audiophiles who want a fun pair.  They're exceptional for the price, and would still be competitive at five times the cost.  I'm really glad I decided to give these a try.",

        "review": "Doesn't have auto pause when you remove from ear, transparency mode isn't the best and ANC works best with music. Now for the good stuff: sounds great and has the option to tune it to sound the way you want (very bass heavy with the option for even more bass), fits great, battery life is great, has dual connection and low lag mode and the magnet in case are really strong and the app is well designed. Overall I love these.",

        "review": "I bought it on Black Friday for $20. I was not expecting much, was getting them for phone calls. Oh boy... these really caught me off-guard, they are actually very good! I have only used them as of this review less than one day, but I have been trying to make them sound as good as the BOSE QC35ii headphones I have (BOSE sound is in another league).Equalizer/Sound:Recommended Equalizer settings on Nothing app:BASS: +6MID: +1TREBLE: 0Ultra Bass: Level 5For rock, these settings are the best you can probably get (of course they still sound fantastic outside of rock). I tested these for live-streams (gaming/shooting) and voices sounded normal-good (compared to my headphones), normal songs sounded good, instrumental music (from Elden Ring) sounded very good, rock (I tested Abracadavre, a song from Call of Duty: Black Ops 1) and at around second ~0:20 where the good part starts, sounded somehow disappointing *with the default Dirac equalizer setting*, but once I tested the customized equalizer I just showed earlier it sounded MUCH better (still not even close to the BOSE headphones, but they do sound from acceptable to good now). If you combine these settings with a separate equalizer app, you can probably make these sound much better. The ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) is, like mentioned in Linus Tech Tips, pretty decent-good, it is like 1/3 the strength of the BOSE headphones (ANC from CMF does not hurt the 1st time you use it, I recall the 1st time I used the BOSE ANC that I felt being inside a submarine very deep in the ocean).Microphones during calls: sounds very clear (in a room with metal fans that make strong white noise). I tested by calling myself to another phone.Case: It fits extremely tight on the small pockets that jeans have. So far has done it's  job of charging, but since this is day 1 I will not talk about this aside of saying it works.Connection: Tested on an Asus Zephyrus G15 GA503QR (Linux Pop-OS), Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 and Google Pixel 6. In all it connects fast and stable. Sometimes increasing the volume increases more loudly one bud first but then the other bud catches up, but normally they both do it at the same time. Audio to video latency, okay-good. When I start a YouTube video the audio kicks in at like second 1-2, but after that no noticeably latency (very slight latency whenever I saw someone in a video game shoot, the sound and visual recoil of gun did not match, maybe 0.2-0.4 ms latency guesstimating by eye).Ear tip fit: pretty good, I recommend trying the large one for a better seal, so the ANC is better (not by that much).Does it fit: Yes, it does not fall off at all, can sleep while wearing them comfortably (sleeping on the side).Is this worth it? Yes (in my case, for $20 this was a steal), but I will suggest looking the Plus version of these earbuds since (I believe, please check first) the equalizer settings on the Nothing app for that earbud is much more detailed and advanced, also you can modify how strong you want the ANC to be (and has like personalized audio, whatever that means). The CMF Buds 2 Plus is $80 and CMF Buds 2A $50, so if you see the Plus in discount closer to $50 I suggest you get those; otherwise Buds 2A for less than $30 is very good deal (both are reviewed in Short Circuit channel on YouTube). Pretty satisfied.Updated 12/7/25:1. Bluetooth range: Much better than my Bose, very surprised.2. Battery life is very good, was in a call for like 2 hours and still had like 65% I believe.3. This supports the feature that Airpods have of \"seamlessly\" connecting between multiple devices and switching fast (I have not tried it, but you need the Nothing app to enable it.Annoyances:1. No way to disable hang up calls and other call specific touch gestures. I accidentally hung up a call trying to adjust my buds.2. The touch sensor is VERY sensitive, and... essentially the WHOLE stick of the bud is detected by the sensors, so just adjusting them at the tip (the opposite side of the sensor's location) will still hang up the call, so be careful.3. If bud slides off your ear, use a smaller size. For me small size prevents them from falling off.So far very good and solid performance.",

        "review": "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",

He said he only charges them about once a week and uses them for about 3-4 hours a day. He let me use them during the first month our newborn came home and they saved my life since our baby had colic. They are also very compact so they fit inside of his pocket perfectly, even with a case. The bass quality is superb for such little buds too. Definitely worth the price and after a year they havnt lost any quality in sound.",

        "review": "Like I assume many others have, I looked at this product as a cheaper alternative to the Apple AirPods. To be entirely honest, I was expecting mediocre sound quality and battery life. I turned out to be delightfully surprised by how much I like these earphones.The sound quality is very clear, perhaps not \"audiophile\" tier, but let's be honest: no earphones are audiophile quality at $30. I've heard people complain about latency when watching videos. I personally haven't experienced that. Whenever I watch a YouTube video, I don't notice any latency, though I suppose that I could be not as sensitive to that as other people.  The battery life is also pretty decent (not mind-blowing, but solid).  The Bluetooth is easy to set up as per the included instruction booklet; pairing them with my iPhone 6s was a cinch.They are comfortable to wear. I'm usually not a fan of the squishy rubber found in a lot of earphones\u2014I usually wear over-the-ear headphones or hard plastic ones\u2014but for some reason, I think these earphones are comfortable. Differently sized rubber pieces are included, in case you prefer a larger or smaller size.The only gripe I have with this product is that no charging cable was included. I mean, Micro USB cords are ubiquitous enough, so it's not egregious.",

        "review": "*Third revision* getting the headphones to pair to each other was a bit of a nuisance and the left bud seems to have some connection issues as far as the charging case is concerned. Once paired successfully, they function great as headphones, and the sound cancelling is great. The fit is also very nice. So aside from the pairing/charging issues I've come across in my short time I find them to be pretty good. *update* I've used the buds for the last day and have been able to discern where the problems lie. The connection issue is solved pretty simply by turning the left bud off and on again, and when I looked closer at the charging case I noticed that the prongs in the left compartment were considerable shorter than the right ones and one of them was even half stuck under the plastic! This rendered the left bud unchargeable because it couldn't complete the connection. *new* used a thumbtack to gently pry the stuck prong out and all has been well for the last few days of continued use. I will say that, as someone with smaller ears, the fit, though quite snug, became uncomfortable after prolonged usage (more than an hour and a half). 4 stars because of the initial pairing/charging issues",

Very good quality, good bass, and cheap.But this time I got impatient and bought from Amazon for the sweet 2-day delivery. Crap! They crackle on certain frequencies and it's unlistenable. Even the start-up sounds crackle. Really annoying too, because I need the charging case because I lost my other pair's... but it also has a bad connection to the pins. Probably due to the earbud tip size which was included with my AliExpress order...I would advise not this seller.",

Battery lasts forever. Easy to charge. And because they're so cheap, it's not a big deal if you lose them, like every time I lost my $100 airpods because all apple products are designed to slip out of your pocket and into a crack in a couch or something (iphones, appletv remote, mac mini, etc). As for the quality, i'm not an audiophile and was born without the ability to appreciate or connect with music, so maybe I'm not the best guy to consult. But I can say that they sound great to me. If you're some nasty freak who walks around going \"oh my lows, oooh my mids, ooooh my tweeters!\" then you're probably already looking for your airpod pros in your loveseat.

Sure since it is smaller you can't expect booming bass, but it does a decent job overall.  Doesn't feel cheaply made.  I just got it so I'll see how long the little included battery will power this, but so far I am well pleased with this \"little monster\".

        "review": "I recently purchased the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active and I\u2019m absolutely impressed with them. For the price, they deliver exceptional sound quality, comfort, and functionality that I didn\u2019t expect at this price point.Sound Quality:The 12mm dynamic driver produces clear, balanced sound with deep bass and crisp treble. Whether I\u2019m listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the sound quality is rich and immersive. The audio is loud enough to block out background noise, but still clear and precise, which is great for workouts or commuting.Bluetooth Connectivity:The Bluetooth\u00ae 5.3 connection is super stable and ensures there are no drops or interruptions, even when I\u2019m walking around or moving my head. The connection pairs quickly and smoothly with my phone and other Bluetooth devices. The Google Fast Pair feature is a convenient addition, allowing me to connect the buds to my phone instantly.Battery Life:The 28 hours of listening time with the case is impressive. Even after long listening sessions, I don\u2019t need to worry about charging them constantly. I can go through an entire workday or long trips without having to charge them, and when they do need a charge, it\u2019s quick and easy with the compact case.Comfort & Fit:The buds are lightweight and fit comfortably in my ears. They don\u2019t feel heavy or bulky, and they stay securely in place even when I\u2019m on the move. I can wear them for hours without discomfort, which is important for my long listening sessions or calls.Design:The Graphite Black color is sleek and modern, with a nice matte finish. The case is compact, making it easy to throw into my pocket or bag without taking up too much space. The overall design feels premium, especially considering the price.Conclusion:Overall, the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active are a fantastic choice if you\u2019re looking for affordable yet high-quality earbuds. The sound quality, Bluetooth connection, and long battery life make them an excellent value. If you're looking for reliable wireless earbuds for everyday use, I highly recommend these.",

The sound quality is exceptional, with crisp highs and deep bass thanks to the 12mm dynamic driver. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio experience is clear and immersive. The Bluetooth 5.3 connection is super stable, and I\u2019ve had no issues with connectivity or dropouts.The fit is incredibly comfortable. The earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and snug fit for different ear shapes. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, and the noise isolation is great, blocking out most external sounds, which enhances the listening experience even more.The battery life is impressive as well. I\u2019ve been able to use them for several hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides plenty of additional power for multiple uses. The touch controls are responsive and make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls without having to pull out my phone.Overall, these earbuds are an incredible value for the price. The Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active deliver on sound quality, comfort, and battery life, making them a perfect choice for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. Highly recommended!",

When I bought this item I was like \"I like my other Xiaomi products, let's try this one\". Audio quality is _great_. That's both \"listening to music\" audio quality and also \"other people say that they can hear me perfectly on phone calls\" quality. Battery life is also great. The device paired instantly with my Pixel and setup was basically zero steps. Three sizes of ear cushions are included, the default ones fit me without any need for swapping. I was really amazed at how other people on the phone said \"Sure I can hear you fine, why are you asking?\" Never had that experience with the cheap earbuds :) Thoroughly recommend these, at least for Android users - I haven't tried on iPhone.",

I know this can be bought separately, but I would love to see a protective case included, as you can see, mine are a little scuffed because of having them in drawers, bags or sometimes dropping them. on that same topic of dropping those, I'm very clumsy, and I have dropped them a few times and they still resist the impact, especially the case which with some other earbuds has broken for me. I do own a Redmi phone so I've never had any compatibility or connectivity issues, they connect really fast and rarely get disconnected by moving around.",

I'm a sound engineer (for live sound) so when I want to put in earbuds I want them to be the best. And so far these are it for me.

I live in America, however I do have the supportive app because I have a VPN from Thailand.But like I said, it doesn't really matter if you can get the supportive app or not.

      {
        "review": "These Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Hi-Res LHDC Earbuds are comfortable to wear, and the sound is pretty good...but for several reasons, I was torn between giving them three stars or four.  I'm going to preface my review by mentioning that I'm using them with a Xiaomi phone (13T Pro) because the experience of pairing and using them will likely be different on non-Xiaomi devices and because Xiaomi phones have a following here but aren't widely used in the United States.As soon as I opened the charger case and took out the headphones they were recognized by my phone and a pop-up menu came on my display to pair them.  I didn't need to go into the Bluetooth menu or Bluetooth Pairing Mode first, but that's almost certainly because I'm already using a Xiaomi phone.The pop-up menu may suggest that you go to the Play Store to download the Xiaomi Headphones App.  A bar code for the app is also included in the packaging of the headphones.  The problem if you live in the United States is that the Xiaomi Headphones App is indeed available in the Play Store, but not for download here.  You can download the Android app directly from Xiaomi's website in Taiwan or likely find it on an APK Site, although downloading it directly from Xiaomi is probably the safer choice.If you already own a Xiaomi smartphone running HyperOS, then you don't need the app because all of the menu options available in the app are baked directly into HyperOS.  If you go into the list of paired Bluetooth devices on your phone and click the right arrow a menu with headphone options  (see pics) comes up that's identical to the interface from the separate headphones app.You can specify what happens when you single, double, and long press the right and left earbuds, choose between using AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs (more on that particular setting in a moment--but if you read no further, NEVER USE THE AAC BLUETOOTH CODEC ON  AN ANDROID DEVICE), and manually enable the ANC which does very little on my phone--possibly because it isn't compatible with the AI Features in HyperOS.  I can tell when ANC is turned on and off, but it has so little practical effect in terms of reducing ambient noise that activating it is pointless.  In the menu options ANC shows up under Laboratory  Functions as Comfort and noise reduction and needs to be manually enabled every time you connect the headphones.  Since this is a Laboratory Function, that probably means it's either experimental or still in active development.  The other possible reason it's not part of the main controls may be that the ANC works better on some devices than others, since it's a function that relies heavily on AI to work.To be fair to Xiaomi---the ANC in Bluetooth headphones from Bose, Sony, and Samsung also relies on AI to work, unlike older wired headphones, where the ANC functioning was completely hardware-based and built into the physical body of the headphones themselves.  Bluetooth ANC headphones often require an app and attempt to leverage the AI Capabilities built into your smartphone CPU to do most of the noise-cancelling heavy lifting.Earbuds don't offer sound quality comparable to over-the-ear headphones at the same price point, but you're sacrificing great sound for convenience and portability.  As far as earbuds go, these Xiaomi OpenEar sound quite good with nice definition and a balanced range that keeps trebly music from sounding shrill or bass-heavy music from sounding muddy.  I own earbuds from Skull Candy, Sony, Xiaomi (from their cheaper Redmi line), and Zipforce and these easily sound the best.I also appreciate the ear hooks because I have trouble with fit and comfort with some earbuds.  These stay in place over the ear, and I don't have to worry about them popping out and losing one or both.  Since they sit just outside of the ear, wearing them causes no discomfort or ear irritation over extended periods of use--problems that I often encounter with in-ear style earbuds.So if these sound good and are comfortable, why was I strongly tempted to give them three stars instead of four?The gesture commands don't work as well as they should.  Using a single tap to raise or lower volume is fine although I wish a single tap didn't change the volume quite so much--but the double tap commands to stop and restart music don't work reliably to the point where I've given up on even trying to use them--if I'm at a register or in another situation where I would normally want to pause music I turn down the volume instead because turning down the volume actually works.  Using the double tap on either earbud more often than not gets registered as two separate taps to change the volume or as a single long tap to access Google Assistant (Gemini) but since accessing the assistant makes it ready to listen, I didn't realize that the assistant on my phone was being activated.While the ANC does little on my phone call quality is good even in noisy environments and people at the other end of calls can always seem to hear me so there is some kind of noise cancelling going on with phone calls that does work well.Now a quick warning about AAC:In the Audio Menu for the headphones under Audio Quality you can choose between AAC which is listed as High Quality and SBC which is listed as Standard Quality.  That's not an accurate description on Android.  SBC has been capable of high definition sound since Bluetooth 5.0 and AAC is an Apple Bluetooth codec that works very poorly on Android devices.  Even if you're listening to a music source with the AAC Audio Codec you shouldn't use the AAC Bluetooth codec thinking that it passes through the sound.  Despite sharing the same name the AAC Audio Codec and Bluetooth codec are two separate things.  The AAC audio codec is capable of reproducing full CD-quality sound.  The AAC Bluetooth codec is not.  The AAC Bluetooth Codec re-encodes audio rather than passing it through even on Apple devices.The menu toggle for the headphones allowed me to switch between AAC and SBC on the fly while listening to songs.  With a lot of music, you can barely tell any difference between the two.  But with songs that are difficult to reproduce because there are multiple instruments playing simultaneously or music that uses reverb to create atmosphere and space the AAC Bluetooth Codec cuts off audio frequencies well within the range of normal human hearing.  Sound is clipped and songs have noticeably less range.Final Verdict:  If having effective ANC is an important feature, then I definitely can't recommend the Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Hi-Res LHDC Earbuds.  The tap gestures beyond single taps to change volume also work poorly.  But these are very comfortable to wear, they sound nice, and if you're using a Xiaomi phone running HyperOS, all of the headphone controls from the separate headphones app are baked right into the OS.  For me, these were worth the money, but they may not be the best choice for everyone--especially in the United States, where Xiaomi phones aren't that widely used.",

        "review": "This Xiaomi Mini has easily the best sound of any compact Bluetooth speaker I've used.  Sound is clear and balanced, and also surprisingly full for a speaker this size.  My tastes run towards new wave and power pop, and this speaker does a nice job with delicate acoustic guitar, plucked strings, and percussive synth notes, preserving the character of the music without allowing the individual instruments to blend into mush, which is what usually happens with speakers this small.Some people may not be satisfied with the level of bass--but the only way to deliver thumping bass without making the overall sound muddy is to have a woofer or sub-woofer separate from the main speaker reproducing the bulk of the instruments.  A speaker this size can deliver heavy bass or it can deliver a balanced sound, but it can't do both--for most music, balanced sound is far preferable.You can also answer phone calls with this speaker, but that's not something that I tested or have any interest in.With an IP 67 rating, this speaker can get wet without being damaged (which is why the product image shows splashing water surrounding the speaker).  The rating means the speaker can be submerged in water for 30 minutes, which is something else that I didn't personally test and really wouldn't recommend.  I did test water contact in the shower, and the speaker held up fine to that.Final Verdict:  For the price and size, this is a pretty amazing speaker.",

Sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker. Working as a stereo pair, with eqMac for slight corrections in my home studio, they sound like an expensive pair of studio monitors.Very durable and serviceable too: my first one fell from the top of a shelf and the battery, and a connector came loose, not allowing it to charge and rattling with bass-heavy music. Long story short, with simple tools I was able to open it up, repair the damage, and put it back together.It\u2019d be perfect if it had USB-C playback \u2014or even a 3.5mm jack, but I don\u2019t see why the whole thing can be hacked once the battery dies.",

Most everything about the watch is excellent.  Set up was easy. I gave it only four stars because the sleep tracking seems inaccurate, missing most of the awake time. Also, the auto detection of workouts just takes too long to detect that you are working out.  But, the step counting, GPS, heart rate, SPO2, music control, phone functions all are very good.  I do wish that you could see distance in miles as opposed to kilometers and that you could reply to text messages (you can see the message but not reply).  I love the beautiful large display; the amazing battery life and how quick it charges; and its flawless touch sensitivity and operation.  All in all, I am very happy with this watch.  And yes, the watch band was not very convenient as other owners have reported but you can purchase a variety of different bands that attach very easily on TEMU, AliExpress, or Amazon.  I bought several bands that I love.",

Every once in a while the heartrate will transfer over, but it'll only transfer a very small data set, and then it won't transfer again for hours or days, even if I try to manually sync.I love all the good features, but this negative ones outweigh everything else. I reached out to the manufacturer about it, literally got zero response. Very disappointing because I have purchased 6 of their phones in the past, and some other devices from them.",

The 50dB hybrid noise cancelling works extremely well \u2014 it blocks out gym noise, traffic, and background chatter easily. I love the smart dial on the case; it makes volume and switching modes super convenient. Battery life is excellent too, and the fast charging is a big plus. For this price, these earbuds feel like a premium product. Highly recommend!",

        "review": "I wasn't expecting these to be bad by any means, but they are certainly better than I had expected. Sound quality isn't as good as my KZ PR1, which isn't a surprise, but otherwise they are a very solid sounding earbud. I love the case, the knob is a nice feature, maybe a bit gimmicky, but it works and I use it all the time. The battery lasts me easily a whole day at work, which is 10 hours. I could likely go a week without charging them. I don't use the noise cancelling, but the transparent mode works well. The app is pretty nice too, good amount of customization and all around a solid experienceFor context on sound quality - I listen to mostly heavy metal, so very loud and constant music, and they handle it just fine. The bass never feels stressed or like it's distorting(I have the bass boost on its lowest setting), and the mids and highs are clear enough. I don't ever listen at more than about 50% volume.",

        "review": "Out of the box, these sound shockingly good. Like stuff you get from $100-$180 pairs good. Pair that with a really nice feature set, a good app and EQ control, then you have one great value set of buds right here. It's light and have a really good seal that didn't fall out of my ears even while sprinting on a treadmill.Speaking of the app and EQ, it is heavily recommended you use their app. Not only to have access to many of the features, but to also tame theses buds a bit. While the vocals and separation are quite well tunned, they are also tuned heavily towards bass and its treble is a bit high for my taste. Sadly, the app only lets you control Bass, Mids, Treble, so attempting to tame that bass also affects the sub-bass.  Still, my issue with it is mostly due to the genre of music I listen to causing me to constantly reach for my phone to tune that EQ to keep it from being fatiguing. But if you listen to genres that love that type of sound signature, like EDM or Hip-Hop, then these would sound perfect as that extra bass does help those genres sound extra punchy.",

        "review": "Use these daily as a landscaper, they are not rated for water but they regularly have gotten wet with no adverse effects! They sound just as good if not better than my Pixel buds Pro they replaced. The noise cancellation is better in most cases. I ride motorcycles and they fit well inside a helmet and have superior noise cancelling when it comes to wind noise compared to the Pixel Buds Pro! The Case is very handy while riding or working as well, being able to remotely turn down the volume or program your own responses on  the buttons is wonderful. Battery life and overall connectivity is great, they last most of a whole days work at volume they should probably not be at and I have often walked away from my phone and forgotten about it unfortunately!Value for the Dollar, It is incredibly hard to beat these.I use Sony WH1000MX4s for noise cancellation while sitting at a deskI use Skullcandy Skullcrushers while working outAnd these while working outside or not wanting to use over the ear headphones they have replaced my WF1000XM3s, and my Pixel Buds Pro.If you cant tell I like listening to music of different varieties. And these work well as all rounder headphones with great ANC (no it wont beat over the ear headphones) but its still great! Helps when working with large machinery too.",

        "review": "The sound is good, the fit is good, the case is really cool, and it has functionality. The CMF Buds Pro 2 are earbuds that I never expected to purchase this year, and I was shocked by the sound quality.Last year, I purchased the first generation of CMF Buds. The result: subpar sound quality, not that bassy, and I was disappointed. I returned them and thought to never purchase CMF Buds again, until now.The CMF Buds Pro 2 are different earbuds. The case is a decent size, not AirPods-like but that smart dial is really addicting to fidget with and it is really helpful when your phone is in your pocket. You can simply twist the dial to roate volume which is great.Bluetooth connectivity works well, no issues. LDAC is supported but for me I don't really use LDAC that much. I have also talked about how LDAC never really means it is \"better\" but my ears don't like the sound of LDAC. It has dual pair so I can pair both my earbuds and laptop which is good; however, for Windows, you may experience a glitch where the earbuds are near unusable. You have to go to settings and disable a certain feature. It is a common glitch with Windows and Bluetooth devices, not a fault of the CMF Buds.For the sound quality, I was surprised by the default tuning. The Dirac Opteo tuning sounded really good for my ears. Vocals are indeed clear, and instrumentals are really good too. The spatial audio, while it doesn't have any head-tracking, enhances the sound quality. The sound feels more open, and when listening to music, it is relatively enjoyable. From rock songs to rap, the default sound signature is really well tuned (again, for my ears, you may think something different). There is a bass slider, which is cool, and I set that to Level 1. It doesn't distort sound at all and makes the listening experience much more enjoyable. Dirac Opteo is indeed more bass-focused; many earbuds around this category focus on bass (Skullcandy, JBL, Samsung, etc). However, even with this bass-focused sound profile, vocals do sound clear, and instruments sound clear as well, not overpowering vocals; however, in certain songs, instruments can sometimes overpower vocals. The other EQ profiles do not sound well in my opinion, and the custom equalizer should be improved. The weight of the actual earbuds is fairly light, and they are comfortable. The case is portable and can fit in your pocket well.Even with the bassy sound signature, the sound, in my opinion, suits me. I think many people would enjoy the sound quality. The app is also really well-made, better than Soundpeats' application, as well as Skullcandy's. Great job on the Nothing team for developing a really well-made budget pair of earbuds (with a cool case).",

They were out of the Apple Care warranty period and I was waiting until they went on sale over the holidays to replace when I saw the positive reviews on the Soundcore P30i.  I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.

Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.

        "review": "For pure sound quality, I recommend the Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs(Black) over these. They are an off-brand, but popular, semi \u201cin ear monitor\u201d quality earbud. However, these Soundcore P30i are a lot easier to set up, change modes, an use, while not giving up much in terms of everyday music and video quality. Especially when watching tv and movies, you won\u2019t likely notice any difference.So, let\u2019s start with a \u201cstrong average\u201d rating for these earbuds. No bad habits. No annoying faults. No weird emphasis on one part of the sound spectrum.How is set up? Well, be prepared for NO pairing button on the case or inside the hood. These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

These enter paring mode automatically the first time you pull them out and remove the little plastic tabs off the charging spots. They will automatically pair with the most recently paired device IF it is on. Otherwise they go into pairing mode. If you really want to move them to another device, please delete from your old device first so you know what\u2019s going on. (No probblem if your phone is stolen and you want to re-pair to your new phone).There is another step that I recommend. Download the Soundcore app. Use it to customize your settings. Especially you need to deal with ANC - activve noise cancelling. Do you want it On, Off, or Automatic? And set up the desired right and left ear \u201ctaps\u201d for usual stuff like activating a voice assistant or answering a call.THE AUTOMATIC ON-OFF FOR ANC IS SOMETHING I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN BEFORE. It doesn\u2019t activate in my apartment even when noisy trucks go by. I assume if activates automatically on airplanes, where the engine and airstream noise are constant (other reviewers have flown and confirm this. HOWEVER, given the new menu on the control panel, make sure your earbuds are in Automatic mode; when these first shipped (I have early release and current release firmware versions) they were Automatic only, with no way to \u201cforce\u201d ANC as with other ANC earbuds. I think these should ship in Automatic mode, but they seem to ship in ANC-off mode now; use the app to select Auto mode, and to set the taps you want to use to cycle through the three ANC, Normal (silicone tips block some external sounds), and Transparent modes (Transparent uses the mics to relay external sounds through to your ears, as though you don\u2019t have silicone noise blocking tips in the ear canal).Finally, the current firmware adds a chime to the three modes as you cycle through them.I would like to see a set of XL for extra large ear tips. Apple has started doing this. It is a challenge for some earbud designs since the cup holding the tip would need to be larger so the earbuds fit, but then the stem with the charging pads might wobble. Apple and Beats seem to be the only makers with the XL option.With L tips on, I have a good, but not snug, fit. On other earbuds with ANC test modes, I need noticeably snug earbud tips or I don\u2019t bass the onboard ANC test.I intend to keep the app on my device for my next flight and test out Automatic and forced ANC modes and see if there is any difference. Also, to compare to the original Beats (not the later Plus) version) earbuds. I don\u2019t need high fidelity inflight, just enough ANC so I can actually hear dialogue over the cabin roar.Finally, I have a drawer of varioius ANC options. Why did I invest another $30 in these? Disposability plus Anker assurance. In terms of disposability, keep in mind these don\u2019t have a necklace - if one wiggles loose from yawning or eating and rolls away, it\u2019s probably toast. No shrill alarm mode to help find it. Anker assurance? With the exception of a recalled powerbank, Anker has meant solid middle of the field design and reliability. Better audio than pre-Bose Skullcandy, actually comparable to the Solo Buds from Beats, but best value taking into account price, featrures, and quality. Heck, even without noise cancelling I would have bought these. With ANC they are a steal.Then add in the neat built in phone stand, and killer battery capacity for 14 hour flights? No brainer.",

I thought for less than the price of just the Apple Care warranty alone that I\u2019d give them a try so I picked up a pair in black.  I was shocked with the quality of the earbuds build and performance, WOW!  It paired easily with my iPhone Pro and sounded great, but it wasn\u2019t until I downloaded the Soundcore app that I realized their full potential.  In the app you can set up the functions of each earbud and also select your choice of sound quality.  For me the surround sound option blew my AirPod Pros out of the water.  Unbelievable!  And the bass is spectacular.I was so thrilled that I immediately purchased another pair as a backup and have since purchased two pairs as gifts for friends at the gym who had Beats and AirPod pros and they were both blown away.  Finally, we all agreed that these earbuds stay in your ears better too, once you find the best fit among the three choices provided.  And the battery life is great.  There is also a function to use with more than one device, so I often use them with my iPad as well.  Just Google the easy to follow directions for easy pairing of two devices.In conclusion, my Soundcore P30i earbuds are by far my best discovery on Amazon over the years, not only for the insane savings over AirPods (for less than the cost of Apple Care alone), but the excellent sound quality, which IMHO is far better.

        "review": "Good watch. I have had it just over two weeks now and I am very happy with it. The size is right for me, the display is large and easy to read and there are plenty of watch faces to choose from. I'm not into sports or workouts so it's had light use so far. At just over two weeks it still has over 50 percent charge. I like the sleep tracker and heart rate monitor and the text and phone alerts have been useful. I've used the timer function too and it beats having to pull out my phone and go through the process of setting a timer on it. I swapped out the band it came with after wearing it a few days. I prefer the old-fashioned style that has a buckle and keeper loops to hold the free end. For under $50 I think it would be hard to find one that works this well. Set up was fast and easy, too.",

It reads all the general parameters like sleep qty, more than 20 types of excerciso modes, you can read messages, you can control your camera, it has vibration for notfications and alarms (the alarm sounds) and many more.

        "review": "i've had this watch for 9 months now, and i've had some other decent brands before those failed on meI bought it for a sleep tracker and fitness monitor with really good reviews on youtube (very likely paid).i ended up using it as a basic watch with message/calendar notifications and convenient media control, which works for me, but that should be about the expectationPros:- stylish watch, rich in functionalityCons:- integration with android is suboptimal, red icon in the notification bar always- watch voice call is really nice to have, however it messes up other BT devices, i couldn't have both watch and car connected. Car is must have, therefor had to turn this off.- with watch voice call disconnected, watch does not show calls, it only notifies of a missed call after it gets dropped- exercise auto detection buzzes every time i walk anywhere, had to turn it off- i have a doubt that heart beat is accurate, it showed 90 bpm when my heart was pounding- exercise tracker has some SW bug, when it's turned on it's a matter of time when the watch goes reboot and looses all traction, it works okay for a short exercise, but for a long jog or a bike ride, it'll reboot- gps experience is frustrating, i ride a bike, i stop for a sip of water and it stops the tracking, reboot with time make it even more frustrating- sleep tracking is nice but not accurate. it made me smile when it recognized me sitting in a dentist chair as a nap time- touch screen action is not well filtered, sometimes you find your watch deep in settings, if you go shower with the watch, it'll change things on the phone, SW does not filter accidental touches well",

I was kind of on the fence buying this because the case material is NVCM plastic, but it looks and feels really nice and the watch is very lightweight. Setup was very easy. There are also a ton of different wallpaper's you can customize with. Hope it gives me many years of service. Sleep function is nice too",

The built in speaker for calls is great, connection to my phone is seamless (granted I have a xiaomi phone), and I've genuinely turned on all the features except always on display and I'm yet to drain the battery. If it's anything like the mi band 5, charging won't be an issue since I'd only be  doing that once every other week or so.There are plenty of videos online on the features and interface and if you're buying this I'd recommend watching those but it's pretty simple to use and understand.",

I didn\u2019t expect much, honestly\u2014just something functional. But what I got was a full-on game changer.These have become my go-to earbuds for everything. I\u2019m a full-time student, which means I\u2019m constantly switching between reading, running to class, zoning out to music, or escaping into a podcast while doing dishes or walking to the library. I needed earbuds that could keep up with me\u2014and these do. They\u2019re comfortable, snug, and stay in place no matter what I\u2019m doing. Whether I\u2019m on a packed train, on a long flight, or trying not to disturb my roommate during a late-night study session, the sound quality is consistently clear, rich, and immersive.

        "review": "I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this \"review\" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).",

        "review": "I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this \"review\" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).",

        "review": "I don\u2019t usually write reviews. But after over a year with the TOZO T10s, I feel like I owe them a love letter.I used to own AirPods. And then I lost them. Then I replaced them. And lost them again. Repeat that cycle more times than I\u2019d like to admit\u2014until one day, I\u2019d had enough. I wanted earbuds I could trust to stay in my ears, stay with me through a chaotic student schedule, and not cost half a paycheck to replace.That\u2019s when I stumbled across the TOZO T10s. I didn\u2019t expect much, honestly\u2014just something functional. But what I got was a full-on game changer.These have become my go-to earbuds for everything. I\u2019m a full-time student, which means I\u2019m constantly switching between reading, running to class, zoning out to music, or escaping into a podcast while doing dishes or walking to the library. I needed earbuds that could keep up with me\u2014and these do. They\u2019re comfortable, snug, and stay in place no matter what I\u2019m doing. Whether I\u2019m on a packed train, on a long flight, or trying not to disturb my roommate during a late-night study session, the sound quality is consistently clear, rich, and immersive. Like, weirdly good for the price.I\u2019ve taken them to the beach, I\u2019ve worn them in the rain, I\u2019ve accidentally dropped them in coffee once (don\u2019t ask)\u2014and they kept going. The waterproofing is not just a gimmick; it\u2019s saved me multiple times.The battery life? Unreal. I charge them maybe once every two weeks, and that\u2019s with daily use. It\u2019s one less thing to stress about, and for me, that alone makes them worth it.Now here\u2019s where the story gets even better.After over a year of near-daily use, my left earbud started acting up. Not totally dead, just inconsistent. I figured, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve definitely gotten my money\u2019s worth\u2014time to buy another pair.\u201d But I decided to shoot TOZO an email, just in case. One single email. No hassle, no waiting on hold, no weird hoops to jump through. They responded almost immediately, and within a few days, they shipped me a replacement. Just like that.In a world where companies make you feel like a number or a nuisance, TOZO treated me like a human being. That kind of customer service and product support is rare\u2014and it made me a loyal fan for life.If you\u2019re looking for earbuds that punch way above their price tag, survive the unpredictable chaos of daily life, and come with a company that actually cares\u2014the TOZO T10s are it.I don\u2019t miss my AirPods. Not even a little.",

Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).",

I'm still rating 4 stars because I want both, would put 4.5 but can't. I don't see why both sides need a long press for google assistant or siri, one of these long presses could change the noise mode.) I would still pick the JBL buds because the volume steps are more gradual. I can get these to a comfortable level where with the Sony ones it always either a little too loud or a little too quiet. Other than volume I love that the controls are capacitive. Sony opted for actual push buttons in theirs which makes them unusable when laying on your side or for example working on your car, as you constantly bumping/pushing the buttons inadvertently in both cases -- so big win for the JBLs.Overall, a quality earbud for the price but improvements could be made, not sure you can find a more feature rich earbud for this price.",

They have decent bass and a pretty balanced sound. Better than my old beats but not quite as clear as my previous JBL. Battery life is great for me, they have not died while using them. And the case holds an enough charge for a couple days, sometimes even a week.Overall, if I paid full price I wouldn\u2019t be upset. The noise canceling helps but is not full cancellation.

        "review": "I bought these to help filter out noise at the office generally for music listening. I will split the review into three section: Noise Cancelling, Sound Quality, and Other.Noise Cancelling:They will work for some people but not all. At the home office they work great, they filter out the frequency of noise produced by computer fans. However, I don't believe the noise cancelling is all that adaptive, rather it is just filtering a fixed number of frequencies. For example, the higher frequency noise from my air purifier is still noticeable, but dampened. This seems to be the case with all noise. I would expect their algorithm is doing something like filtering out the average frequencies in the average environment so overall you do indeed get a quieter listening experience.  \u0336I\u0336 \u0336f\u0336i\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336\"\u0336A\u0336m\u0336b\u0336i\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336A\u0336w\u0336a\u0336r\u0336e\u0336\"\u0336 \u0336s\u0336e\u0336t\u0336t\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336b\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336q\u0336u\u0336i\u0336e\u0336t\u0336e\u0336s\u0336t\u0336.\u0336  (UPDATE: Meant to say ANC (duh) slightly confusing what mode I was in based off of the quick start manual. Ambient would be if you wanted to hear more than if the ANC was just off.) For the price this is very acceptable. The more adaptable, on the fly noise cancelling algorithms are extremely difficult to implement, and hence you pay a premium for them. Overall, I would compare these to a really good pair of foam tip IEMs in terms of noise cancellation. These will definitely not provide any hearing protection for things like shooting, loud shop work, etc... so keep that in mind and use your head.Sound Quality:These are definitely a \"consumer  grade\" listening experience, which for most people won't be a bad thing. For the price I am indifferent. I would say the bass is higher than normal with more muted/muddy treble. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I would say most people would find them \"good\".  For what they cost, the sound exactly like what I would expect, better than a 20 dollar pair of headphones and not as good as a $150 dollar pair of IEMs, but your mileage may vary. For comparison with a competitor, I have some Sony wf-c500 wireless earbuds (no ANC) and these sound roughly the same, maybe slightly less clear treble and bass. I would still pick these over the Sony's because these have more features for the price and for other reasons I will list below.Other:Battery -- I think the battery life specs are roughly accurate, I get a full day on them, but haven't really pushed them to the 40 hours though. Battery life seems great, the case seems to get you maybe 2 charges. The case is nothing special, I wish the hinge had more tension in it like the Sony's so it felt more premium, I can kind of wiggle it a little bit but definitely not a deal breaker. I have yet to run them to the point where they alert you if they are low just once or they keep doing it. If they keep doing it I will update and remove a star because I don't quite understand why you would annoy the user with a message consistently for the last X% of battery (original rating is 4 stars).Size and Eartips -- these are rather large, but acceptable given the price and feature set.  They don't fit in the ear as well as the Sony ones do but they don't seem to fall out either. The Sony design fits into the ear better and \"hugs\" it so to speak, they seal better as well. I do really wish these came with a set of foam tips, they would actually compete in a different price bracket for that much, mainly because of the noise reduction. They would also help the fit. The included silicon ear tips are like the cheapest on the market, not as supple as more premium earbuds. There's nothing inherently wrong with them but they may rip after a while. I think if JBL addressed the fit (decrease the depth of the \"body\" in the ear so they seal better since there would be  less weight pulling down on the eartip) and eartips they'd have an extremely solid 50 dollar pair of earbuds.Controls -  \u0336U\u0336n\u0336l\u0336e\u0336s\u0336s\u0336 \u0336I\u0336'\u0336m\u0336 \u0336m\u0336i\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 \u0336i\u0336t\u0336,\u0336 \u0336I\u0336 \u0336d\u0336i\u0336s\u0336l\u0336i\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336c\u0336o\u0336n\u0336t\u0336r\u0336o\u0336l\u0336s\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336d\u0336j\u0336u\u0336s\u0336t\u0336m\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336,\u0336 \u0336m\u0336a\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336m\u0336i\u0336s\u0336p\u0336l\u0336a\u0336y\u0336 \u0336f\u0336r\u0336o\u0336m\u0336 \u0336J\u0336B\u0336L\u0336,\u0336 \u0336l\u0336o\u0336o\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336 \u0336s\u0336t\u0336a\u0336r\u0336 \u0336f\u0336o\u0336r\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336.\u0336 \u0336I\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336w\u0336a\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336i\u0336n\u0336v\u0336o\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336 \u0336a\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336s\u0336t\u0336a\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336r\u0336a\u0336i\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336.\u0336 \u0336T\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336S\u0336o\u0336n\u0336y\u0336 \u0336e\u0336a\u0336r\u0336b\u0336u\u0336d\u0336s\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336;\u0336 \u0336h\u0336o\u0336w\u0336e\u0336v\u0336e\u0336r\u0336,\u0336 \u0336  (UPDATE: Volume controls can be added through the app as a functionality; however, you loose the ability to change noise modes.

I would expect their algorithm is doing something like filtering out the average frequencies in the average environment so overall you do indeed get a quieter listening experience.  \u0336I\u0336 \u0336f\u0336i\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336\"\u0336A\u0336m\u0336b\u0336i\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336A\u0336w\u0336a\u0336r\u0336e\u0336\"\u0336 \u0336s\u0336e\u0336t\u0336t\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336b\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336q\u0336u\u0336i\u0336e\u0336t\u0336e\u0336s\u0336t\u0336.\u0336  (UPDATE: Meant to say ANC (duh) slightly confusing what mode I was in based off of the quick start manual. Ambient would be if you wanted to hear more than if the ANC was just off.) For the price this is very acceptable. The more adaptable, on the fly noise cancelling algorithms are extremely difficult to implement, and hence you pay a premium for them. Overall, I would compare these to a really good pair of foam tip IEMs in terms of noise cancellation. These will definitely not provide any hearing protection for things like shooting, loud shop work, etc... so keep that in mind and use your head.Sound Quality:These are definitely a \"consumer  grade\" listening experience, which for most people won't be a bad thing. For the price I am indifferent. I would say the bass is higher than normal with more muted/muddy treble. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I would say most people would find them \"good\".  For what they cost, the sound exactly like what I would expect, better than a 20 dollar pair of headphones and not as good as a $150 dollar pair of IEMs, but your mileage may vary. For comparison with a competitor, I have some Sony wf-c500 wireless earbuds (no ANC) and these sound roughly the same, maybe slightly less clear treble and bass. I would still pick these over the Sony's because these have more features for the price and for other reasons I will list below.Other:Battery -- I think the battery life specs are roughly accurate, I get a full day on them, but haven't really pushed them to the 40 hours though. Battery life seems great, the case seems to get you maybe 2 charges. The case is nothing special, I wish the hinge had more tension in it like the Sony's so it felt more premium, I can kind of wiggle it a little bit but definitely not a deal breaker. I have yet to run them to the point where they alert you if they are low just once or they keep doing it. If they keep doing it I will update and remove a star because I don't quite understand why you would annoy the user with a message consistently for the last X% of battery (original rating is 4 stars).Size and Eartips -- these are rather large, but acceptable given the price and feature set.  They don't fit in the ear as well as the Sony ones do but they don't seem to fall out either. The Sony design fits into the ear better and \"hugs\" it so to speak, they seal better as well. I do really wish these came with a set of foam tips, they would actually compete in a different price bracket for that much, mainly because of the noise reduction. They would also help the fit. The included silicon ear tips are like the cheapest on the market, not as supple as more premium earbuds. There's nothing inherently wrong with them but they may rip after a while. I think if JBL addressed the fit (decrease the depth of the \"body\" in the ear so they seal better since there would be  less weight pulling down on the eartip) and eartips they'd have an extremely solid 50 dollar pair of earbuds.Controls -  \u0336U\u0336n\u0336l\u0336e\u0336s\u0336s\u0336 \u0336I\u0336'\u0336m\u0336 \u0336m\u0336i\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 \u0336i\u0336t\u0336,\u0336 \u0336I\u0336 \u0336d\u0336i\u0336s\u0336l\u0336i\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336c\u0336o\u0336n\u0336t\u0336r\u0336o\u0336l\u0336s\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336d\u0336j\u0336u\u0336s\u0336t\u0336m\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336,\u0336 \u0336m\u0336a\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336m\u0336i\u0336s\u0336p\u0336l\u0336a\u0336y\u0336 \u0336f\u0336r\u0336o\u0336m\u0336 \u0336J\u0336B\u0336L\u0336,\u0336 \u0336l\u0336o\u0336o\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336 \u0336s\u0336t\u0336a\u0336r\u0336 \u0336f\u0336o\u0336r\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336.\u0336 \u0336I\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336w\u0336a\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336i\u0336n\u0336v\u0336o\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336 \u0336a\u0336s\u0336s\u0336i\u0336s\u0336t\u0336a\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336r\u0336a\u0336i\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336.\u0336 \u0336T\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336S\u0336o\u0336n\u0336y\u0336 \u0336e\u0336a\u0336r\u0336b\u0336u\u0336d\u0336s\u0336 \u0336d\u0336o\u0336 \u0336h\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336v\u0336o\u0336l\u0336u\u0336m\u0336e\u0336;\u0336 \u0336h\u0336o\u0336w\u0336e\u0336v\u0336e\u0336r\u0336,\u0336 \u0336  (UPDATE: Volume controls can be added through the app as a functionality; however, you loose the ability to change noise modes. I'm still rating 4 stars because I want both, would put 4.5 but can't. I don't see why both sides need a long press for google assistant or siri, one of these long presses could change the noise mode.) I would still pick the JBL buds because the volume steps are more gradual. I can get these to a comfortable level where with the Sony ones it always either a little too loud or a little too quiet. Other than volume I love that the controls are capacitive. Sony opted for actual push buttons in theirs which makes them unusable when laying on your side or for example working on your car, as you constantly bumping/pushing the buttons inadvertently in both cases -- so big win for the JBLs.Overall, a quality earbud for the price but improvements could be made, not sure you can find a more feature rich earbud for this price.",

At the time I only paid 50 bucks because of a sale.Overall they are great at that price point. They are made out of plastic so they do feel a little cheap. But so far I have not had any issues with durability. The fit is surprisingly comfortable and they don\u2019t slip out of my ear. Sound overall is solid. They have decent bass and a pretty balanced sound. Better than my old beats but not quite as clear as my previous JBL. Battery life is great for me, they have not died while using them. And the case holds an enough charge for a couple days, sometimes even a week.Overall, if I paid full price I wouldn\u2019t be upset. The noise canceling helps but is not full cancellation. And they do not auto pause when I take them out of my ears. Both features I wish were better at a 100 price point.But for 50 bucks they have been excellent.",

        "review": "First Thing: UPDATE these ear buds. You need to do it TWICE! Get the JBL app for your phone and software update the buds, then get the JBL Quantum Engine App for PC (or Mac) and do the firmware update. Before the updates I could only get one bud/channel to work with Android using the dongle, and after the updates both buds work. So far I have tested the USB-C Dongle with PC, Steam Deck, iPad, and Android - it works well with all devices listed providing low latency, and high(er) fidelity, sound. I tested multiple games on Steam Deck, including Hi-Fi Rush (a rhythm game), and had no latency issues. The Dongle is true plug and play (no setup needed) on every device except PC. Plugging in the USB-C Dongle prompted a download of Quantum Engine, and inside the QE app you can set EQ and tweak the Surround Sound settings. I tested the buds in Battlefield V on PC and the surround sound worked well. Adjusting the EQ in the QE app on PC is easy and necessary in order to get the most pleasing sound. The only device I\u2019m using Bluetooth with is my Android phone and the sound is fine - use the JBL app to adjust the EQ. The Android App offers a FULL EQ, not the typical/lame EQ for dummies a lot of ear bud devices ship with.I\u2019ve only had the JBL Quantum TWS Airs (that name lol) for a short time, so I can\u2019t offer a comprehensive review yet. I will say they are very light and fit well in my ears. There is no wing, or stabilizer, so these might not be great for active on-the-go situations. The stock EQ needed a tweak for my ears, and the Apps make that easy. The sound quality via the USB-C Dongle is a noticeable upgrade in terms of latency and fidelity. These are better for music than I anticipated, and from reviews I read this is one of the big differences from the more expensive, and older version, of this line of Quantum TWS buds. Battery life is much shorter using the Dongle, and that makes sense as the low latency signal is more power hungry than Bluetooth. I spent some time looking for low latency wireless ear buds and this is one the most affordable options out there ($40 on sale). Hopefully in time more companies will offer similar low latency earbuds, or maybe Bluetooth will get good enough to make a product like this irrelevant.",

The case is a little too big for carrying it on a pocket but still can fit. It charges pretty fast too and I appreciate that.The voice assistant is very useful, it can read and answer message and read u all your notifications. Also control smart home devices which I use a lot.Only problem with it is that the dongle doesn't work very well with other smartphones or tablets, I read that the Pc firmware update can fix that but my Pc doesn't have a usb-c port and I haven't been able to buy an adapter (and it can't connect to the pc app by Bluetooth for some reason).Definitely a good purchase still just for it's in-app customization, voice assistant features and sound quality.",

        "review": "So I bought these earbuds on discount for $75 on Black Friday, and I want to share some thoughts I have about this thing.1. It's not exactly perfectly low latency. I play rhythm games a lot, and I do notice a slight amount of latency even with the \"low latency\" dongle mode. I've tried disabling any audio processing on Windows, but it's still the same. The latency is fairly low given that it's wireless. You'll be hard pressed to notice for other games like Valorant, but there's just a touch of latency which prevents me from using it for rhythm games in particular.2. Audio is pretty good. Very bass heavy as you'd expect, but there is an EQ so you can change it around. Once you balance it out with the EQ I think the audio quality is quite exceptional for these buds.3. Battery life is mid. When you use it in low-latency mode the battery dies in around 3-4 hours without ANC or processing. Probably take off an hour if you had it on. The bluetooth mode lasts for much longer, I'd peg it around 6 hours (although I've never fully drained it in bluetooth yet).4. Charging is fairly fast for both the case and the earbuds.5. There are some strange audio artifacts (glitching and occasionally choppy audio) with the dongle. This happens very occasionally, and I've tried disabling interference like from Wi-Fi and other 2.4Ghz accessories but it still occurs.6. I think the touch controls are hard to learn. The one for switching modes is fairly straightforward, but pairing, switching, and learning play/pause is not intuitive.7. Noise cancellation is quite weak compared to many other earbuds on the market, similar with the \"transparency mode\" on these things. Talk-thru actually is OK, but sounds artificial and you can definitely tell the noise from outside is piped in.8. They sit comfortably in the ears and don't feel like they're gonna fall out. However, at least for me, they get uncomfortable over like 1 hour of wearing.Overall, given the discounted $75 price I think they're a great pair of buds, better than other $99 Bluetooth buds on the market. At the original $150, there are much better options (without low latency dongle).And gamers beware, if you are planning to use these for latency critical audio tasks, these are NOT for you. Stick to wired or look for something else. These get quite close but I still notice a tad bit of audio latency.",

Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.",

        "review": "I bought these to replace a set of Airpods of which the battery life was quickly becoming abysmal. The purpose of the headphones was convenience. They are kept on the table beside my chair in the living room. They are easy to get to when I want to listen to something like a youtube video and not have wires so I'm not tethered to my device if I need to get up to the let the dog out. The best thing about the airpods is they were made so they don't plug into my ear canal. Most ear buds just work their way out of my ear canals so not having that issue was a major plus. Since they are dying I decided to see what else would fill that role that would have better battery life. I looked for ratings and advice on the Internet. These JBLs seemed to be what I needed for the same price as a new set of basic Airpods. The only negative was they have tips that fit into ear canals. Since the rest of the ear bud looked like it would sit in the outer ear almost like the Airpods I decided to risk it. I had to put the smallest tips on them to get them in my ear canals. The left one slowly works it's way out over time unless I really push it in deep but it hasn't been a big issue. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is very nice. Being able to customize the EQ in the app was really great so I could tailor the sound to my liking. These aren't audiophile quality but I would hope that wouldn't be expected at this price point. They pair up with my Ipad immediately every time. I have done any extended listening but the battery life has been great. It's very convenient to be able to put the case on a charging pad instead of having to plug it in. The noise cancellation works pretty good in my opinion. I don't have anything else with noise cancelling to compare it to. I do find it funny that it blocks most of the sound from the tv but when my wife talks to me I can hear her at a significantly reduced level but still fairly clearly. Noise cancellation isn't important to me so I leave it off almost all the time in favor of increased battery life. The most important thing I can say is if I was in the market to buy another set of wireless ear buds, I'd buy these again with no hesitation as long as the reason I was looking for another set wasn't because these stopped working in a short period of time.",

        "review": "Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range.

I fall asleep with these JBLs in and in the morning they still have at least half battery after sitting out of the case all night long. Second want for ear buds was something better at noise canceling than airpods (husband snores). These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don\u2019t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it. Only complaint, and this is totally my fault, is that the rubber tips are slightly too large for my ears and they fall out a lot or make my ears sore. But they came with either replacement rubber tips or different sizes in the box when i got them and i threw them away. Since then ive been having a hard time finding generic replacement tips that don\u2019t disrupt the charging on these. But like i said that\u2019s on me. Anyways TL:DR baby best the price, excellent battery life, above average noise cancelling.",

These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don\u2019t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it.

BUT THESE HAVE IT!  i put on TPAB to check and YEAH, THESE ARE GREAT!  the familiar songs i know so well weren't lost to some cheap engineering or budget components.  but for my normal use case scenario--listening to political news on a low volume while i'm working from home, listening to hip-hop media while cleaning the kitchen, or listening to reddit stories to drown out my man's snoring on those extra-loud nights, these are phenomenal.  also EXTREMELY comfortable.  i love the skin-tones they came out with, too.  that's so frickin cute and thoughtful that i had to get a pair in my own skintone even though i'm more of a white/black girlie.  it's so nice to have them blend in rather than be this white, obvious thing in my ear.  i LOVE the app--it shows the battery level, lets you check for updates MANUALLY, but also has an equalizer, CUSTOM TOUCH CONTROLS!!!!!!!!! which i of course used to mimic the touch control of airpods just for ease of use, allows you to even set a volume limit to protect your ears.  also comes with some built-in ambient noises which i am a big fan of.  and the awareness feature -- i am assuming this is maybe for people who go on walks???  or, like me, wear them a lot but still have conversations here and there.  i'm so super impressed with these LITERALLY TWENTY DOLLAR earbuds, i can't say it enough!!!i want to state that i am in no way compensated for this review, nor is this one of the increasingly-common AI-generated reviews you'll see on this platform, i am just genuinely so surprised by the quality and the comfort of these.  i think these are an amazing, affordable option for anyone who is ready to burst out of their expensive Apple comfort zone, or on a budget trying to save up for something they think is \"nicer\" (trust me...you might change your mind on that part).  these would make a wonderful gift for teens who lose things (i know all too well), or even just to have around as a backup pair.  if i were still working in an office, i'd probably buy another to keep in my desk.  they're THAT GOOD.still TBD is how well they work with a PC -- i've only used them with my phone, so far.  if i decide to try that out, i'll come back to update :)",

But to my surprise, this pair of earbuds works really well, and the sound quality is solid.  The earbuds pack with operating features that are responsive.  The device connects to my phone right away and stay connected throughout my workout.  The pair of earbuds feel relatively comfortable to wear and fits snuggly in my ear canal.  The device stayed securely in my ears most of my workout routine, but there were a few occasions I had to adjust the fitting as I felt the device slipping out of ear.  I find it useful that the device comes with a very short built-in usb-c female charging cable that tucks underneath the charging case where I do not need to carry around a charging cable and comes with multiple silicone ear tips to make the device fit to my ear canal size.  I also like the \"aware\" feature that amplifies the surrounding sounds to make me aware of what is around me, especially when I am riding a bike on a busy street.  One thing I was not too thrilled about was the effort it takes to remove the earpiece out of the case.  Some reason I had hard time getting a good grip on the earpiece to remove it out of box, especially when the two earpieces are together in the case.  Perhaps it is my poor grip or the slippery material of the earpiece, but it took a lot more effort than I expected to remove the earpieces.  Other than that, this product offers good quality sound at a reasonable price.  The question is... how long the battery will last....",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been using the JLab Go Air Pop+ earbuds for about two months now, and overall I\u2019m really impressed with what you get for the price.First off, the sound quality is very decent for budget true wireless earbuds. They\u2019re not meant to compete with premium models, but for everyday listening\u2014music, videos, and calls\u2014they sound clear and punchy. The EQ3 settings are a nice bonus and actually make a noticeable difference depending on what you\u2019re listening to. The mic is not bad.. whoever I'm talking to can hear me but there's no noise canceling at all which can be annoying if you're in a noisy environment.Battery life is another strong point. I don\u2019t find myself charging these often, and they easily last through multiple days of casual use. The dual connect feature is convenient too, especially if you want to use just one earbud at a time.There\u2019s no active noise canceling, but that\u2019s expected at this price point, and honestly I didn\u2019t miss it. Passive isolation is fine for normal use.My only minor complaint is the built-in USB-C charging cable. It works, but it\u2019s a bit annoying having to plug the case directly into an adapter instead of using a separate cable. Not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of. Also the touch controls are a bit finicky and you have to learn the gestures for left and right buds separately.Overall, these are a great option if you\u2019re looking for affordable, reliable earbuds with good sound and excellent battery life. I\u2019d definitely recommend them to anyone who wants solid performance without spending a lot.",

One thing I was not too thrilled about was the effort it takes to remove the earpiece out of the case.

        "review": "These started out at $200, I waited and waited and got them for $100. Worth the wait. These are high-end earbuds for sure. As high end as Bluetooth can be anyway. I believe they are now back up to $200.Initially, when I first used them, the sound seemed low for the sound level I'm accustomed to on other earbuds. But as my ears acclimated to them...or possibly the earbuds burned in...the sound became more involved and I can hear a wider soundstage than with other earbuds.Overall sound is clean, crisp and clear. The bass is strong if you have and can maintain a sufficiently tight seal in the ear. The stock eartips didn't provide a reliable seal so I installed the largest eartips I have from my Panasonic RZ-S500W earbuds. That did the trick. Reliable seal and they fit in the JBL charging case.The charging case is a little on the large side, but it's still okay. Excellent build quality. Battery life so far on the buds and case are great. But I rarely use earbuds longer than 3 hours so BL isn't much of a concern to me.For reference, I have or have had the earbuds listed below. I will say that I am favoring these JBL earbuds over all of them but my Master & Dynamic MW-07. But I grab these more often because the M&D earbuds don't last more than 2.5 hours battery life. And at about 1.5 hours they produce a warning sound that repeats every so often. Nevertheless, the M&D sound quality is among the best I've ever heard.[Ranked ONLY for sound quality from best to worst]Master & Dynamic MW-07Technics EAH-AZ70W (Best ANC and exceptional sound quality, but battery depletes while powered off)JBL Tour PRO+Technics EAH-AZ60Sony WF-1000XM4 (Bought for \"World leading ANC\". Returned. Their ANC wasn't better than the Technics EAH-AZ70W and their sound wasn't exceptional enough)Sony LinkBuds SJBL Live FreeNC+ (very small, nicely compact case, but limited custom eartip selection that will fit in the case)Moondrop SparksPanasonic RZ-S500WSennheiser CXSennheiser CX 400BT",

Comparatively on price, these match to many top name brand earbuds on the market, however they blow the competition out of the water! Other than a having a hard time finding a comfortable fitment for my smaller ears, as these buds are bigger than most, the pros of this product outweigh everything negative by miles!The sound quality is unparalleled for the price, with an insane immersive audio, that can be fully adjusted and controlled from the app!The easy to operate touch controls are not overly sensitive, preventing that annoying accidental command. Battery will last longer than my phone, and working in a factory setting, I keep them in for the noise canceling all day without recharge.Currently looking for a protector case, similar to my samsung pros waterproof case, as the charging case does seem a bit brittle like all others, but that doesn't mean anything! I will be back with an update on the charging case.",

        "review": "I bought these to connect to my computer for work from home.  They would not stay connected to a laptop...any laptop.  I tried several and the buds would just disconnect from them.  I called jbl who then said it is a computer problem because they would connect to my phone so I decided to try to use them with my phone because they were not cheap.  I know they are nowhere near the cost of the gold standard option but for my budget they are not cheap.  Here is the process to using them.  First, moisten the rubber pads by breathing on them.  Then jamb them into your ear until it feels as though you shoved a lit candle into your ear.  Turn on the noise canceling.  This part is essential to block out background noise then crank the sound all the way up.  This is not to jam out to rock,  this is just so that you can hear the audio book you are listening to.  Yeah, I'm that guy that listens to audio books for fun.  Now DO NOT MOVE.  Don't blink, don't look around ot they will jump out of your ears with even minor movement.  Try the different sized earpieces.  It will slightly adjust the heat level of the lit candle and will have no impact on how secure they are in your ears.  Turn off noise canceling and turn on ambient aware and you can hear mumbled conversations the neighbors the next block over are having.  Don't worry about privacy, nothing is clear enough to understand a word.  It is the same with someone conversing with you in the same room.  You get a great impression of Charlie brown listening to a class lecture, only amplified.  The last straw was today when I tried to spare my family of the latest book and only the left bud will connect.  It just so happens you have to have the right bud to do much of anything.  So for the bargain price of about $8 per use I have come to the end of the lifespan of these buds.  Not bad for what a jbl representative assure me is the quality that I should expect.  I will end this 9-month journey by biting the bullet and looking at some samsung buds or maybe a pair of Raycons.",

        "review": "These started out at $200, I waited and waited and got them for $100. Worth the wait. These are high-end earbuds for sure. As high end as Bluetooth can be anyway. I believe they are now back up to $200.Initially, when I first used them, the sound seemed low for the sound level I'm accustomed to on other earbuds. But as my ears acclimated to them...or possibly the earbuds burned in...the sound became more involved and I can hear a wider soundstage than with other earbuds.Overall sound is clean, crisp and clear. The bass is strong if you have and can maintain a sufficiently tight seal in the ear. The stock eartips didn't provide a reliable seal so I installed the largest eartips I have from my Panasonic RZ-S500W earbuds. That did the trick. Reliable seal and they fit in the JBL charging case.The charging case is a little on the large side, but it's still okay. Excellent build quality. Battery life so far on the buds and case are great. But I rarely use earbuds longer than 3 hours so BL isn't much of a concern to me.For reference, I have or have had the earbuds listed below. I will say that I am favoring these JBL earbuds over all of them but my Master & Dynamic MW-07. But I grab these more often because the M&D earbuds don't last more than 2.5 hours battery life. And at about 1.5 hours they produce a warning sound that repeats every so often. Nevertheless, the M&D sound quality is among the best I've ever heard.[Ranked ONLY for sound quality from best to worst]Master & Dynamic MW-07Technics EAH-AZ70W (Best ANC and exceptional sound quality, but battery depletes while powered off)JBL Tour PRO+Technics EAH-AZ60Sony WF-1000XM4 (Bought for \"World leading ANC\". Returned. Their ANC wasn't better than the Technics EAH-AZ70W and their sound wasn't exceptional enough)Sony LinkBuds SJBL Live FreeNC+ (very small, nicely compact case, but limited custom eartip selection that will fit in the case)Moondrop SparksPanasonic RZ-S500WSennheiser CXSennheiser CX 400BT",

        "review": "I have been very eager to try these, and after losing my beloved Samsung pros, I decided I had to buy! Comparatively on price, these match to many top name brand earbuds on the market, however they blow the competition out of the water! Other than a having a hard time finding a comfortable fitment for my smaller ears, as these buds are bigger than most, the pros of this product outweigh everything negative by miles!The sound quality is unparalleled for the price, with an insane immersive audio, that can be fully adjusted and controlled from the app!The easy to operate touch controls are not overly sensitive, preventing that annoying accidental command. Battery will last longer than my phone, and working in a factory setting, I keep them in for the noise canceling all day without recharge.Currently looking for a protector case, similar to my samsung pros waterproof case, as the charging case does seem a bit brittle like all others, but that doesn't mean anything! I will be back with an update on the charging case.",

If  zoom/phone calls or books are your purpose for getting these, it\u2019s a top notch product much more affordable than Apple\u2019s earbuds.",

For what I paid I'm very happy, it connects to many devices with no problems. Only wish the  windows functionality was as good as the android one, but when using on my phone they're wonderful. Loud coworkers are totally silenced if playing music even quietly and the passthrough mode works great.",

        "review": "The earbuds are comfortable, fit well on the ears and provide good sound quality. BUT, for some unknown reason the microphone simply does not work. If I connect them for a call, I listen through the earbuds but the active mic is the one from the source device, so the other party hears extremely bad. It happens with Android and Mac, so, no chance to say it is an issue with those devices.I contacted JBL support and they didn't find any solution, so, at the end, I had to return the item back to Amazon.",

They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3\u2019s.  I\u2019m an audiophile on a budget. They can\u2019t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they\u2019re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I\u2019ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that\u2019s due to the EQ setting I\u2019ve selected.  You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven\u2019t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the \u201cambient-aware\u201d or \u201ctalk through\u201d modes. That\u2019s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don\u2019t seem to have any functional ANC.  I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They\u2019ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1.  However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc.  it\u2019s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don\u2019t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.",

The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I\u2019m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore\u2019s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I\u2019m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I\u2019m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple\u2019s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple\u2019s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I\u2019ve accepted that earbuds in general just won\u2019t last forever with daily use, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I\u2019m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore\u2019s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",

They would barely work with Apple products, and they'd work okay with Microsoft products. I submitted for an exchange or refund WITHIN DAYS OF RECEIVING THEM, and Amazon rejected both. I then contacted JBL and started the process over. I very clearly explained that I had done all of the trouble shooting possible. I was told to try the troubleshooting again, as there was no other option. I told them I wasn't going to waste my time, and that they needed to make it right. I got no reply.A week later I got an email requesting a review of my service, HILARIOUS. I let them know I received a defective product and was ignored by both Amazon and JBL. I told them you're welcome for the free money.I immediately got a reply apologizing and information to return the defective products, as well as a tracking number for the replacement pair.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues, although not as severely. I decided to keep them because wasn't interesting in spending more time begging to get what I'm owed. Aside from the audio issues, the casing on these have begun to chip off. These headphones sit on my desk all day. They do not get jostled inside of a bag or moved around whatsoever.I've had these second pair almost a year, and now they work even less then the original pair did. I'm going to go to the gas station and buy a $5 pair, drive over them with my car a few times, and they'll still sound better and be more durable than these earbuds ever did.JBL, I never wanted to talk to you again, but you're about to hear from me.

I had to replace an old pair of airpods because they wouldn\u2019t hold a charge longer than 30 minutes. My primary focus was battery life. I fall asleep with these JBLs in and in the morning they still have at least half battery after sitting out of the case all night long. Second want for ear buds was something better at noise canceling than airpods (husband snores). These are exceptional at noise cancelling and you don\u2019t have to turn the volume up super loud to achieve it. Only complaint, and this is totally my fault, is that the rubber tips are slightly too large for my ears and they fall out a lot or make my ears sore. But they came with either replacement rubber tips or different sizes in the box when i got them and i threw them away. Since then ive been having a hard time finding generic replacement tips that don\u2019t disrupt the charging on these. But like i said that\u2019s on me. Anyways TL:DR baby best the price, excellent battery life, above average noise cancelling.",

Frankly, I don't know how they can sell them so reasonably.  I had a pair of large, with full ear cups, bluetooth headphones to listen to TV.  My wife doesn't like the high volume so I had to wear them all the time during the day / evening with the TV audio muted when watching unless we were watching a movie / TV program she wanted to watch with me.  Now I can hear her and the TV simultaneously so she doesn't have to yell at me to override the old headphones.  The audio is perfect.  The old headphones were extremely poor for high frequencies and were very heavy with the bass.  Without the high frequencies everything sounded muffled and forget trying to understand what foreign actors are trying to say on my favorite shows.  I could understand 20-40% of what they were saying no matter how loud I had the headphones jacked up and background music in the film / TV show just made it all that much worse.  No longer!  Great audio, lots of high frequency response so I can watch everything now and understand all the words being spoken.  These work great for music, too, on my iPhone and MacBook devices.  I bought a bluetooth transmitter on Amazon (1Mii SafeFly Dual | Bluetooth 5.3 Adapter Bluetooth Transmitter w/Screen for Wireless Headphones), plugged the 3mm audio plug into the headphone jack on the TV and away we went after pairing.  The SafeFly transmitter mentioned comes with a USB charging port so I just plugged it into a USB to AC adapter into the outlet behind the TV so it remains fully charged at all times.  These are great for the hard-of-hearing like myself.",

I managed to see where it landed and it's a crane zone so I had to get my boss to get it.. he found it still worked.. a few weeks go buy I fumbled the whole case ear phones and all in the freezer where I work all the time.. I loose one found the other. A week goes buy and one of my friends in janitorial was cleaning mind you another 3 storys.. finds it! I charge it up it still works! Another time samet headphones bc it's got a different color rubber on it bc I lost the one it came with.. I was doing some cleaning in another dept and had a mop bucket next to me full of kinda Nasty water.. not gonna lie. I feel the head phone slip out of my ear.. and I tried to catch it bit instead hand paddled it right into the mop bucket \ud83d\ude05 I kid you not.. it was in there for a good 10 seconds bc I had to roll up my sleeve to reach in.. I flicked it off dried it with a cloth real good left it in my bag so it could get the monster out before charging it.. and sure as shoot it still works.. but they have become a bit annoying now bc I do work in the freezer below 0 for like 12 hours 5 days a week.. nothing charges in that.. I still use both sets they usually die about 4 hours to 5 hours in and I swap to my husband's old pair lol. But I can't complain with these they have quite a story to tell. \ud83d\ude05 I do wish they were rated below 0 so they lasted longer but sometimes if they do die I just leave them in they make for great noise canceling with all the fans and belts going it gets loud and when I hear the fans running it makes me even colder so even dead they have there use.The bass is also great.Case could have a cover but they still hold on with Magnet.",

Good mic, quality when you\u2019re talking to someone on the phone battery life noise, cancellation I\u2019m telling you these are really a nice set of earbuds to get in for the price you really can\u2019t go wrong.",

My bose lasted me a good like 10 or more years they still work but are falling apart so I got these I can confidently say these are just as good if not better than my bose very comfortable in my small ears and the sound quality is top tier!! They also have better noise cancelation than my bose and no sound leaking out for other people to hear. I like how portable these are with a clip on the case so I can clip them on my jeans instead of putting them in my pocket which was my issue with my bose because the case is really big. They were really easy to connect through the app I was also able to connect them without the app but I personally like using the app because it tells you information like the batery of each earbud and lets you cusomize the sound along with other things.",

I can go a week without charging the case, though I usually only use one at a time in public.The sound is amazing and they fit in my ears comfortably.The only negative is that the outside plastic piece fell off of one of the buds within a few days. I'm careful with them and don't remember dropping it or anything. It doesn't affect the function, just makes the button harder to push. Small negative that I just wanted to mention.All in all, they are incredible earbuds when considering the price,volume, sound quality, and especially battery life. The clip is also very handy",

I\u2019ve had the dime 3 for over a year now as my go to and I upgraded to the dime evo today, the difference in features is wild considering this pair is $60, only a few dollars more than the dime 3. They sound great and neutral, work seamlessly with 2 devices at once, and thy have the app to control the equalizer.

        "review": "So I can say this, the dime evo has great battery life for the earbuds and the holder of the earbuds.Noise cancellation is really good but may attenuate some of the high frequencies, but that could be just my ears.Tap three times on the left earbud and you hear sound around you.Tap again three times and you\u2019re back into noise cancellation.I have to say that I\u2019ve been very impressed by this model in all aspects.They fit my ears very well and for someone who has very small ear canals I\u2019m very impressed and how well they fit.I could be jogging or in a full run, and I have no worries of them ever falling out! so if you\u2019re looking for some earbuds that have really good clarity very easy to control your volume on them. Good mic, quality when you\u2019re talking to someone on the phone battery life noise, cancellation I\u2019m telling you these are really a nice set of earbuds to get in for the price you really can\u2019t go wrong.",

My bose lasted me a good like 10 or more years they still work but are falling apart so I got these I can confidently say these are just as good if not better than my bose very comfortable in my small ears and the sound quality is top tier!! They also have better noise cancelation than my bose and no sound leaking out for other people to hear. I like how portable these are with a clip on the case so I can clip them on my jeans instead of putting them in my pocket which was my issue with my bose because the case is really big. They were really easy to connect through the app I was also able to connect them without the app but I personally like using the app because it tells you information like the batery of each earbud and lets you cusomize the sound along with other things.",

I'm careful with them and don't remember dropping it or anything. It doesn't affect the function, just makes the button harder to push.

The case is great and I love the design. All of this to say they are IMO very much worth the price! I got them on a deep discount but if I had to pay Full price I would not feel ripped off like the SS arctic buds. Highly recomend! Only issue was the ear pads were too small and I had to use some from a different pair. But I have big ears lol! Once I used different pads they sound just like I had hoped.",

The backup batteries are all across the spectrum with this one being the medium but still not great, like the Champions. Sound quality was mid pack but the not far behind the 700's. Function is perfected when it comes to thermal, too sensitive and adjustments become inadvertent actions. Form is really nice as well, i really like the framing, finish and the LED actually looks linear. Connects within a second or 2 and range is similar to skullcandy which imo has the best range I've seen. Love the L/R connectivity as well, normally I had to always carry 2 sets for work. IPX rated so I can work in them and I also like the case with the slide window. The only functions it's missing is ambient microphone and anc but for half the price of the 700's that's ok with me.Update: after using these for a few weeks I wanted to leave a few notes. Battery life on the buds are the best I've seen on individual buds. I'm usually only wearing 1 at a time but most days 1 bud will outlast the battery on my phone and I am almost always listening to something. The charging case isn't quite as good and needs to be charged every few days. The Monster Champions is a heavier case but will last literally weeks on a single charge and daily use. Despite that these are the best buds I've ever owned and I've had literally dozens. I wear these over my ANC 700's, Beats, Klipsch, several JBL's, several Skullcandy's and Sony buds. Lastly, fit is also the best I've experienced. I normally don't have problems finding buds that fit and usually use the supplied medium sized inserts but these stay in place as good as any. I'm not fumbling with them while I work outside in Texas and I love that.",

        "review": "A lot of pros with one con.I didn\u2019t think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, \u201cI haven\u2019t used my Airpods since buying these!\u201d so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc.  I can\u2019t actually remember all of the problems at this point.  BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it\u2019s Black Friday and I bite on these because they\u2019re on sale.  I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars.  Turns out average reviews aren\u2019t everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they\u2019re comfortable, and the sound is amazing.  As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble.  These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ\u2019d. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync\u2019ing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is  very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It\u2019s not a huge deal - it\u2019s easy to pop them in for a split second if they\u2019ve timed out or something.  But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case.  I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL\u2019s part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I\u2019m doing my part to raise it.  In everyday life it\u2019s not that big of a deal unless you\u2019re the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.",

        "review": "I bought these on the Black Friday sale and man, I'm so glad I did.  I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment.  I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out.  Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings!  This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out.  Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear.  Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes.  You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good.  The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time.  I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music.  These are that clear.  They also don't kill my ears!  I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically.  With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app.  Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13.  Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution.  I'd definitely buy these again!",

The quality of the sound Is pristine and clear and has nice bass to it.The problem: it keeps coming off my ear so I find myself usually adjusting it so the won\u2019t fall. It does happens more with the left but both ears do it. Thats the only problem honestly. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it syncs well.Ear size: I also change a bigger ear tip so they fit more snug but still after a while they start coming off even though when I rotate it so stays put But that\u2019s probably also because I\u2019m working out when that Happens.Battery last a long time!",

No sign of life at all from anything. Plugged in case to charge and everything woke up and works fine now! My ear canals are very small and had to use aftermarket smaller tips but fit well now. If you have to use the small or extra small tips usually just order black so they match aftermarket color ones if you care.Only issue I have is you cant have all the ambient controls, media controls, and volume control its two of the three.",

        "review": "After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore. But I do hear my bones rattling around now. I can't fix that. If you are experiencing this I think the foam tips can fix that. No need to buy an expensive pair. Here are the ones I bought. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN4HP5Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 $7.I hope this helps someone. Trust me I'm confident that you will love these too. Especially at the $40 price point. Good luck!",

        "review": "Background:I am a person that even if you ignore the other brand Earbuds I have and like, (with TOZO \u2026 I\u2019d say Tribit and Earfun are up there) \u2026 I have quiet the collection of models from TOZO including the T6s (both variety), T9, NC2 and 2024 NC9s, A1s, Crystal Buds and Crystal Pods, the A3s, and I have experience with the original NC9s and NC7s (I am sure I am even forgetting a model or two) . Oh yeah and the E2s (to answer my own question about the E2s in comparison to these, I will get to that later)My intial thoughts (given that I did have these before my A1s but expected about the same thing) were that the sound BLEW me away for this price .. I do admit I got these for $19.99 with a 6 dollar off e-coupon to make these under $15 (before I go on, I still say these would be worth that $19.99)\u2026 after a first walk of a few miles with the DEFAULT \u201cflat\u201d/\u201dstandard\u201d EQ I tried what I thought was the best option and while usually use custom EQ settings \u2026 I tried the \u201cRock\u201d Preset and after two days of that\u2026 I felt these were dialed in.  JUST now I tried them again and while it\u2019s so close to being \u201cperfect\u201d (so to speak\u2026keep expectations in-check) \u2026 the midbass which IS boosted in the \u201cRock\u201d preset is just a tad too much .. in the great TOZO app I pulled the first few bass sliders to A) line-up and B) are above the \u201czero\u201d line but lower than the Rock preset(like I said in my A1 review, I plan on uploading my preset to the EQ Zone in the TOZO App \u2026 this gives you the ability to download other people\u2019s EQ settings and apply them to YOUR TOZO buds with only a few clicks \u2026 VERY cool and handy) .This sound is really dialed in more to \u201cexactly\u201d how I like it.  The only thing  I may say about these vs say the 2024 NC9 SOUND \u2026 is that things seem more \u201crefined\u201d overall in the 2024 NC9 (crisper, more separation perhaps), but these are DARN GOODBefore I go on \u2026 Build quality, battery life (so far), and that sort of stuff \u2026 seems typical for TOZO \u2026 and that means \u201cit\u2019s great\u201d \u2026 sure compared to some buds these may \u201cfeel a little cheaper\u201d (say the T6s or 2024 NC9s) but THEY DO NOT feel \u201ccheap\u201d.

A) say at 100% volume the A1s are where any other TOZO bud including these are at say 70% volume and that is an issue at times with tracks with lower volumes.  NOT terrible for the A1s but just something to note.  The A1s lack \u201cbody\u201d or \u201crichness\u201d to me in the mids .. .at least compared to say the TOZO T6s for instance.  These E1s just need minor tweaking vs the A1s they are so much like and sound so much better.  I don\u2019t feel the sound \u201cblows me away\u201d as much (if I forget I only paid $13.90 for these) as it did at first but it\u2019s so good for this price range, I am nit-picking at that point. These have the punch in the low end (how much of a punch is what I am dialing in to my \u201cperfect sound\u201d listening to things from light jazz to rap and metal, here) that I feel the A1s lack at times.The E1s have a \u201cmore controlled \u201c bass to me \u2026and without repeated tweaking of the EQ which I am still trying with the A1s .. I am not noticing that \u201csyballant\u201d sound on some of the tracks near the high-end.  (For the record I feel I am trashing the A1s\u2026 I have no plans on returning my A1s and I do NOT \u201chate them\u201d .. I just feel these E1s OVERALL are better)Fit wise the A1s and E1s may not be \u201cidentical\u201d but without trying them on as I am typing this review I cant remember if one is better \u2026 close enough to being the same for my tastes and that is \u201cmaybe not the perfect fit but TOTALLY comfortable\u201dTOZO E2:This will answer my own question about the E2s before I bought those.  The style (even how the case opens uniquely) is really cool and I like that more than I expected.  The build quality of the E2s are about the same as these E1s in my viewWhile I am still dialing things in, NOT saying things sound \u201c100% the same\u201d I am going off memory here to what I like and the tracks (music) I was listening to at the time.  The E2s and E1s are really close and more in the ballpark of each other\u2026. Both in my opinion sound better than the A1s which between the three models are the ones that still lack \u201crichness\u201d at times .. it\u2019s like the E1s and E2s are dialed in even out of the factory, more than the A1s.------------------------------Not sure what I can say specifically that will not make this review too long and boring.  I think between the A1s and E1s that are OFTEN (I got then at an identical price) about the same price\u2026. Regular, lightning deals, or regular price + coupons \u2026 I\u2019d totally go with the E1s, though I feel I am hating on the A1s (again these two models are SO SIMILAR it\u2019s hard to tell them apart sometimes not counting the sound and case-shape) .. the A1s are not bad but these are just a bit better.The E2s I would not say are \u201ca lot better\u201d or worse than these but they are in the same ballpark \u2026 and for about $40 (not counting sales which would bring that down) \u2026 you could get both E1 and E2s.To be honest .. I have more than one pair of these E1s due to e-coupons and sales \u2026 so yes I recommend them",

        "review": "After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore. But I do hear my bones rattling around now. I can't fix that. If you are experiencing this I think the foam tips can fix that. No need to buy an expensive pair. Here are the ones I bought. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN4HP5Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 $7.I hope this helps someone. Trust me I'm confident that you will love these too. Especially at the $40 price point. Good luck!",

        "review": "After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore. But I do hear my bones rattling around now. I can't fix that. If you are experiencing this I think the foam tips can fix that. No need to buy an expensive pair. Here are the ones I bought. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN4HP5Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 $7.I hope this helps someone. Trust me I'm confident that you will love these too. Especially at the $40 price point. Good luck!",

        "review": "After reading several reviews, these T12s seemed to be a very good deal. Especially for the price.I was quite skeptical because the last pair I just returned had some really great reviews too. However, I received my Tozo T12 Earbuds today, January 2, 2021. I received them just as all the video reviews stated with all the items included as advertised. Mine were charged to 85%. I followed the simple instructions and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I was seriously impressed with the sound quality. WOW!I let the earbuds and the base charge to 100%. I had some work to do in the garage that took about 1 hour. This gave me the time to play around with my new earbuds. Did I mention the sound quality? After several songs these  earbuds are incredible. They are light weight and seems like they will stay in place. I was climbing and bending over, moving freely with no discomfort in my ears. In fact I had forgot these were in my ears at one point. I was able to quickly adapt to the touch controls. Very easy.I was having a conversation with my wife (after I paused the music) and I still couldn't hear her clearly. I had to remove one of the ear pieces. The earbud really seals the outside noise very nicely. I'm going to try these when I use the trimmer this summer. They should act as a set of hearing protection and I can listen to music.But my real test is going to be when I use these at the gym. I only bought them for that purpose. For some reason, my gym loves to play some crap music. It sounds like they play the same song over and over and over. It is cruel and unusual punishment. The pair of earbuds I had and just returned never stayed in my ears. With a little sweat, I was constantly fussing with them and not having a good seal made the sound quality horrible. So we shall see if my Tozo T12s will do what the other one could not. From my short experience I have had so far I have confidence these WILL stay put and I will have the sound quality I was searching for. But I will soon find out on Monday!Update, today is January 20, 2021.Let me say, you will not be disappointed with the Tozo T12s.  After a little more than 3 weeks, I have used these while climbing up and down a ladder, bending over, under ear muffs (wood working) just about any position and these ear buds DO NOT fall out and are comfortable. But most importantly, I use them at the gym. I don't go to the gym to update my social status, I go there to sweat and I sweat a lot. These T12s have stayed in place and are comfortable. Never have I had to adjust or fuss with them after putting them in.You get a rich full range of sound. Deep bass and crisp highs. Incredible!! I'm hearing sounds that I have never heard from music that I have listened to for years.You have two sets of volume control. Your device, if turned way down, will affect the volume to the earbuds. And you have a volume control on the earbuds. Think of your device being the master volume control. If it is low or off you will not have very much volume at the earbuds even at full (on the earbuds). I set my devise almost up to full volume and control the earbuds from there.So far I have only had to charge the case only once in three weeks.The only negative thing I can say about these earbuds, the first week in the gym I was hearing a very loud popping sound from my left ear and only after the sweat started to flow. The popping happened with every step while running on the treadmill. It sounded like the cap on a jar when the vacuum seal was broken. But loud. I figured out that the silicone tip, after it was wet, was braking the seal between my ear and the silicone ear piece. I fixed that by buying a set of foam tips. I don't hear the popping anymore. But I do hear my bones rattling around now. I can't fix that. If you are experiencing this I think the foam tips can fix that. No need to buy an expensive pair. Here are the ones I bought. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SN4HP5Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 $7.I hope this helps someone. Trust me I'm confident that you will love these too. Especially at the $40 price point. Good luck!",

        "review": "What the heck kind of title is that you might ask???I have latest Apple Air Pods Pro... and it hard to compare yet I cheerfully have both.I constantly fret about losing my Apple buds with the charge down so I cant find them.It takes all the fun out of it for me.  ALSO the Apple don't have the base that I really like.I didn't want to get the JBL cheapest nor did I want to get the several hundred dollar version either.I have to compromise.. so .. HOPEFULLY this is helpful to someone on the fence like I was.1)JBL never feel secure in my ear and in trying to get them secure I inadvertently reset  or constantly cycle them.However.. Once in my ear.. and seated.. they are nice.. stay put and don't have that look I detest about myAplle ones.. I got the BLACK JBL TUNE BUDS 2 and they sort of dont stand out.  I hate the look that my earsalways have a \"Runny Nose\" look.. the dangling white thing hanging down.. I really appreciate JBL black.2)I have a very hard time figuring out how much charge is in my  JBL Tune Buds.  I only have battery clues thatare in the 3 white lights on the front of the case.  Fine... but I am never sure what charge is where and if buds are charged totally etc.  HOWEVER.. the JBL last through the night for me.  Apple seldom makes it ever so I have to use only one Apple bud at a time.  I really like the immersion of 2 buds to help sleep.  AND>>>  the JBL seem to last, for me, about twice as long as the Apple ones.  Still..  I never know what condition my c ondition is in HOWEVER.. if I get in a pinch.. I can drop back to 1 bud and go on forever with the JBL.3)The range .. for me.. is less for the JBL than the Apple  HOWEVER.. the JBL really are worth the slight drop in distance due to the lovely lovely BASS.. I love Bass.  That would make it hard for me to ditch or ghost the JBL.  I have 4 sets of buds.. A couple free sent for evaluation... however none stand up the quality of Apple Or JBL.  My evaluation free ones were in the $100 range so  I feel the comparison is valid.In conclusion... If you don't want that apple signature drippy white thing hanging down from your ear and you like a GOOOOD Bass thump and a REASONABLY fair price ... I think this is the one f or  you.  The lack of a good battery is still an issue but nor a deal breaker.  It is made up for by insanely fast charge and long battery life....Truly hope this helps a fence straddler..  Cheers",

        "review": "What the heck kind of title is that you might ask???I have latest Apple Air Pods Pro... and it hard to compare yet I cheerfully have both.I constantly fret about losing my Apple buds with the charge down so I cant find them.It takes all the fun out of it for me.  ALSO the Apple don't have the base that I really like.I didn't want to get the JBL cheapest nor did I want to get the several hundred dollar version either.I have to compromise.. so .. HOPEFULLY this is helpful to someone on the fence like I was.1)JBL never feel secure in my ear and in trying to get them secure I inadvertently reset  or constantly cycle them.However.. Once in my ear.. and seated.. they are nice.. stay put and don't have that look I detest about myAplle ones.. I got the BLACK JBL TUNE BUDS 2 and they sort of dont stand out.  I hate the look that my earsalways have a \"Runny Nose\" look.. the dangling white thing hanging down.. I really appreciate JBL black.2)I have a very hard time figuring out how much charge is in my  JBL Tune Buds.  I only have battery clues thatare in the 3 white lights on the front of the case.  Fine... but I am never sure what charge is where and if buds are charged totally etc.  HOWEVER.. the JBL last through the night for me.  Apple seldom makes it ever so I have to use only one Apple bud at a time.  I really like the immersion of 2 buds to help sleep.  AND>>>  the JBL seem to last, for me, about twice as long as the Apple ones.  Still..  I never know what condition my c ondition is in HOWEVER.. if I get in a pinch.. I can drop back to 1 bud and go on forever with the JBL.3)The range .. for me.. is less for the JBL than the Apple  HOWEVER.. the JBL really are worth the slight drop in distance due to the lovely lovely BASS.. I love Bass.  That would make it hard for me to ditch or ghost the JBL.  I have 4 sets of buds.. A couple free sent for evaluation... however none stand up the quality of Apple Or JBL.  My evaluation free ones were in the $100 range so  I feel the comparison is valid.In conclusion... If you don't want that apple signature drippy white thing hanging down from your ear and you like a GOOOOD Bass thump and a REASONABLY fair price ... I think this is the one f or  you.  The lack of a good battery is still an issue but nor a deal breaker.  It is made up for by insanely fast charge and long battery life....Truly hope this helps a fence straddler..  Cheers",

        "review": "...i don't know how these are only $20.  the sound quality is great for the price, but even more broadly, the VALUE IS THERE!  i have used exclusively airpods for the last five or so years, so much so that i kinda forgot that other options exist.  i was here, with one broken airpod (thanks to my dog--he's a good boy who doesn't chew on things but decided my airpod that unknowingly fell out of my pocket looked tasty, i guess?).  this stuck me only using the left one while i \"saved up\" somehow--during the holidays--for a new pair of pros.  after a week or two of using the one, it kinda dawned on me that, wait, there's more out there than just airpods lol.  my man watches a ton of tech stuff on youtube, so it's not like i was unaware, it just didn't click FOR ME that there is more out there that i could actually use!  once he turned me into an Apple girlie, i said there was no going back.  and we all know nothing works as well with Apple than more Apple, right?  it's true; the immediate connectivity and seamless pairing of airpods is unmatched.  i won't sit and pretend that's not true.  but these are a close second, as far as i can tell.  i don't listen to music at home very often, especially not in earbuds; i'm usually listening to news, podcasts, reactions, etc.  so i'm not looking for amazing sound quality by any means.  BUT THESE HAVE IT!  i put on TPAB to check and YEAH, THESE ARE GREAT!  the familiar songs i know so well weren't lost to some cheap engineering or budget components.  but for my normal use case scenario--listening to political news on a low volume while i'm working from home, listening to hip-hop media while cleaning the kitchen, or listening to reddit stories to drown out my man's snoring on those extra-loud nights, these are phenomenal.  also EXTREMELY comfortable.  i love the skin-tones they came out with, too.  that's so frickin cute and thoughtful that i had to get a pair in my own skintone even though i'm more of a white/black girlie.  it's so nice to have them blend in rather than be this white, obvious thing in my ear.  i LOVE the app--it shows the battery level, lets you check for updates MANUALLY, but also has an equalizer, CUSTOM TOUCH CONTROLS!!!!!!!!! which i of course used to mimic the touch control of airpods just for ease of use, allows you to even set a volume limit to protect your ears.  also comes with some built-in ambient noises which i am a big fan of.  and the awareness feature -- i am assuming this is maybe for people who go on walks???  or, like me, wear them a lot but still have conversations here and there.  i'm so super impressed with these LITERALLY TWENTY DOLLAR earbuds, i can't say it enough!!!i want to state that i am in no way compensated for this review, nor is this one of the increasingly-common AI-generated reviews you'll see on this platform, i am just genuinely so surprised by the quality and the comfort of these.  i think these are an amazing, affordable option for anyone who is ready to burst out of their expensive Apple comfort zone, or on a budget trying to save up for something they think is \"nicer\" (trust me...you might change your mind on that part).  these would make a wonderful gift for teens who lose things (i know all too well), or even just to have around as a backup pair.  if i were still working in an office, i'd probably buy another to keep in my desk.  they're THAT GOOD.still TBD is how well they work with a PC -- i've only used them with my phone, so far.  if i decide to try that out, i'll come back to update :)",

        "review": "I bought this pair of earbuds on sale for a very reasonable price, thinking that if it does not work out as expected, I would not be too upset about it.  But to my surprise, this pair of earbuds works really well, and the sound quality is solid.  The earbuds pack with operating features that are responsive.  The device connects to my phone right away and stay connected throughout my workout.  The pair of earbuds feel relatively comfortable to wear and fits snuggly in my ear canal.  The device stayed securely in my ears most of my workout routine, but there were a few occasions I had to adjust the fitting as I felt the device slipping out of ear.  I find it useful that the device comes with a very short built-in usb-c female charging cable that tucks underneath the charging case where I do not need to carry around a charging cable and comes with multiple silicone ear tips to make the device fit to my ear canal size.  I also like the \"aware\" feature that amplifies the surrounding sounds to make me aware of what is around me, especially when I am riding a bike on a busy street.  One thing I was not too thrilled about was the effort it takes to remove the earpiece out of the case.  Some reason I had hard time getting a good grip on the earpiece to remove it out of box, especially when the two earpieces are together in the case.  Perhaps it is my poor grip or the slippery material of the earpiece, but it took a lot more effort than I expected to remove the earpieces.  Other than that, this product offers good quality sound at a reasonable price.  The question is... how long the battery will last....",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been using the JLab Go Air Pop+ earbuds for about two months now, and overall I\u2019m really impressed with what you get for the price.First off, the sound quality is very decent for budget true wireless earbuds. They\u2019re not meant to compete with premium models, but for everyday listening\u2014music, videos, and calls\u2014they sound clear and punchy. The EQ3 settings are a nice bonus and actually make a noticeable difference depending on what you\u2019re listening to. The mic is not bad.. whoever I'm talking to can hear me but there's no noise canceling at all which can be annoying if you're in a noisy environment.Battery life is another strong point. I don\u2019t find myself charging these often, and they easily last through multiple days of casual use. The dual connect feature is convenient too, especially if you want to use just one earbud at a time.There\u2019s no active noise canceling, but that\u2019s expected at this price point, and honestly I didn\u2019t miss it. Passive isolation is fine for normal use.My only minor complaint is the built-in USB-C charging cable. It works, but it\u2019s a bit annoying having to plug the case directly into an adapter instead of using a separate cable. Not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of. Also the touch controls are a bit finicky and you have to learn the gestures for left and right buds separately.Overall, these are a great option if you\u2019re looking for affordable, reliable earbuds with good sound and excellent battery life. I\u2019d definitely recommend them to anyone who wants solid performance without spending a lot.",

        "review": "Very comfortable, decent noise cancelling, both ear bud & case batteries last better than my last pair of Sony earbuds. I do not have excellent ears, age, heredity, and industrial noise have seen to that, so the highs are probably wasted on me, but I have enjoyed the excellent image these buds create; I have a favorite recording of Handel's \"Messiah\", and it's easy to \"see\" where each soloist and group of singers, along with the parts of the orchestra are arranged, like you would at a live performance. As one group sings, then another one comes in you can hear the source coming from another area. The earbuds do work themselves out from time to time, but give warning & are easy to reposition. My last pair was the best Sony model, which I lost one of. I didn't want to drop another $250 , so I bought these. Now I never will. Tremendous value, with no indication of being cheap. One tiny issue: when dropped from waist high or higher onto a hard surface , the case invariably pops open and ejects both earbuds several feet. My fault, of course, but just saying. 10 month update: quality continues; sound is excellent & both earbud and holder batteries continue to last and last.",

They are a bit bulky and it took me awhile to get them to fit and I was actually wearing them wrong to begin with, you\u2019re supposed to put them in your ear and then turn them to the left to screw them into your ears and after I did that they fit so much better. The touch controls work great and I like how you can adjust the controls for your own liking on the app. I use these at work and I can hear everything going on around me as well as what I\u2019m listening to with the ambient aware which is amazing to me. Definitely a lot of features for the money and the battery actually last about 10 hours! I have these connected to my iPhone 17 and they connect fast every time and Siri works just fine as well.

The EQ gives some help, but I still have some work to get them to warm up. Maybe they'll be better after breaking in for a while.My biggest complaint is probably the noise reduction. It works a little, but I can still hear alot of what's going on around me.

        "review": "Pros:Reputation Brand NameGood sound with JBL Headphone appPlenty of bass with JBL Headphone appCONS:FitBluetooth disconnectsI purchased these after mt galaxy bud 2 died, due to one bud falling out into my pool last year then finally died about a month ago.My primary use for ear buds is listening to music while doing yard work (mowing, weed eating, edging) and during pool maintenance (brushing the walls and vacuuming).When I first received these, I downloaded the app and they paired nicely with no issues. Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a \"snug\" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend? Probably notDo i think these were worth what I paid for them? No, with the fit issue, these should cost closer to $19.99",

        "review": "ConThe only bad part about these earbuds is the realme link app. It is not that great. One MUST create an account to use the app. Then, every time you open the app, asks you to sign in, but if you click on cancel, you are already signed in. This is just not acceptable.ProsThe earbuds have a feature called 360 spatial audio. What a difference this feature makes! The sound goes from an above average sound experience to an outstanding experience. I have to say, these are the best earbuds for the price that I have ever owned.I highly recommend these earbuds.",

        "review": "I got these as a lower-cost replacement for the 1st generation AirPods Pro that I had used for a few years (before one of the pods finally met its unfortunate demise), and I\u2019d say they\u2019re just about as good all-around as those were. The fact that these are a quarter of the price of the AirPods Pro is certainly astounding, and I\u2019m legitimately very impressed. I have always thought highly of Anker/Soundcore\u2019s products, but I bought these for $36 (on sale) and certainly did not expect them to be THIS good LOLSound quality: While the sound quality is not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, I found the smart EQ feature on the Soundcore app to be EXTREMELY helpful in getting the p40i earbuds to sound much better. The noise-cancellation of these p40i is also comparable to that of the AirPods Pro 1st gen in my opinion, given that you fit them properly into your ears (and I\u2019m often in a noisy environment). I am happy with the way these sound; I own an expensive pair of over-the-ear headphones and I am generally picky about sound. When I do wear earBUDS though, I am not super super picky, and I just want something that can (1) be easily connected to my device (2) have long battery life (3) be durable, water-resistant. Basically, for earbuds, I\u2019m looking for a workhorse, and these do the job while sounding excellent for the price!Battery life and Durability: I wear these earbuds A LOT (I can hear street noise inside my house at all hours, and wearing earbuds helps me to focus); while walking, exercising, cleaning, cooking, and also while showering (when I am not submerging my head in water of course), and the p40i have been perfect for all of those! The battery life is incredible, even after months of daily use- the battery life of the p40i is definitely better than that of the 1st gen AP Pros (which struggled to maintain even 2 hrs use even when fully charged after 2 yrs). They are definitely water-resistant and durable as well, having survived multiple instances of light water exposure and multiple drops. I have not kept the case in any sort of protector, and there are essentially no visible scratches on the exterior (again, this is another category in which the p40i offers better performance in my opinion than Apple\u2019s airpods).Connectivity + conclusion: I used to think only Apple products could connect so seamlessly to my iPhone (which is a major selling point of Apple\u2019s Airpods), but these p40i changing my mind! 98% of the time, I am connecting these to my iPhone 14. Connection is seamless, and I have only had to fully re-pair my phone and the p40i once in 5 months of ownership (pairing is also incredibly easy). Also, I have a Dell laptop and a Surface Pro (Windows OS), and the connectivity between my computers and the p40i is a much nicer experience than that of my computers and the Apple AirPods.Conclusion: Honestly, I will not be buying any AirPods device again because of the experience I have had with the p40i- although Airpods work great and are nice, I\u2019ve accepted that earbuds in general just won\u2019t last forever with daily use, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend over $100 on them. In 2-3 years when I\u2019m ready for new earbuds, I will likely buy one of Soundcore\u2019s more expensive models as I am truly impressed with the overall quality of these budget-friendly p40i earbuds!",

        "review": "So I have been a huge audiophile my entire life driven with rhythm and sound of nature and creation. I have tried many audio devices and have never quite had the experience that I've been able to receive from soundcore audio. I have purchased the p20, p3i, p40i's twice (one for me and my wife), I also have the space q45, I also recently purchased and reviewed the Aero Fit pro.As far as the p40i they fit a lot differently than the p3is. I personally had issues keeping them in my ears without them falling out which led to their demise in a toilet. However while I had them their voice quality seemed unmatched. Posting the capacity for six mics not only does the noise canceling work amazingly. Near comparable to the q45s capacity. The sound distribution is fantastic providing a deep into you sound.  Touch base control makes it interesting and easy to trigger. In my opinion they are not set up for movement like sports or other physical activities. Connectivity, functionality, battery life and volume control function flawlessly. And overall clarity and value for money they offer a little more than the cheaper variety.",

        "review": "I ordered 3 different earbuds all within a similar price range(+\\- $30) to figure out which one I liked the most - Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, P40i, and JBL Vibe Beam. Here are my notes and comparisons.The Liberty 4 NC is my favorite but there is one aspect I don\u2019t like.They Liberty\u2019s are very clear with good bass and their app allows you to customize EQ settings which is deal breaker for me. (All three pairs have custom EQs within their respective apps). The noise cancellation is great, comparable or even better than AirPros 2 and the fit is superb and on par with the P40i.The JBL Vibe was less comfortable but more so than JBL Tune(ordered these a while back). The JBL Vibes are not noise canceling and I knew that before hand so I\u2019m not knocking it.The JBLs are fine for the price point but not the best for quality as they use 8mm drivers vs 11mm drivers for the Soundcore.The one thing I don\u2019t like with the Liberty\u2019s is the slightest white noise I get when between songs or silent parts. The P40i\u2019s don\u2019t have that problem. The P40i have great bass and fit just as well but they lack in higher frequencies and that\u2019s important for audiophiles. The P40i also have a much friendlier app interface with many more preset features. BUT the Liberty\u2019s have an option to set up your \u201cideal listening EQ\u201d and that is a great feature as it adjusts to your preferred sound through samples and takes the guess work out.Overall the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s took the cake with respect to comfort and sound quality. To me, it was worth the extra $. I can\u2019t speak on longevity as I received all three and have been testing them individually the past couple days.",
